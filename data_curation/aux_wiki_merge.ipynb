       "  'Description': 'Fucking Åmål (released in some countries as Show me Love) is a 1998 Swedish romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Lukas Moodysson in his feature-length directorial debut. It stars Rebecka Liljeberg and Alexandra Dahlström as two seemingly disparate teenage girls who begin a tentative romantic relationship. The film was released theatrically in Sweden on 23 October 1998,[2] and first premiered internationally at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.\\nIt received an overwhelmingly-positive reception[3] and won four Guldbagge Awards (Sweden\\'s official film awards) at the 1999 ceremony. Its international awards include the Teddy Award at the 1999 Berlin International Film Festival,[4] and the Special Jury Prize at the 34th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.\\nThe Swedish title refers to the small town of Åmål in Västra Götaland County, western Sweden. However, only a few scenes were filmed in Åmål,[5] and they were not included in the final product. Primary filming took place in the nearby town of Trollhättan, the location of producing company Film i Väst\\'s studios.[6][7]\\n\\nPlot: Two girls, Agnes and Elin, attend school in the small town of Åmål, Sweden. Elin is outgoing and popular but finds her life unsatisfying and dull. Agnes, by contrast, has no real friends and is constantly depressed. Agnes is in love with Elin but cannot find any way to express it.\\nAgnes\\'s parents worry about their daughter\\'s reclusive life and try to be reassuring. Her mother decides, against Agnes\\'s will, to throw a 16th birthday party for her. Agnes is afraid no one will come. Viktoria, a girl in a wheelchair, shows up and Agnes shouts at her in front of her parents, telling her they are friends only because no one else will talk to them. Agnes, overcome with anger and depression, goes to her room and cries into her pillow shouting that she wishes she were dead, while her father tries to soothe her. Viktoria leaves and Agnes\\'s family eats the food made for the party.\\nElin arrives at Agnes\\'s house, mainly as an excuse to avoid going to another party, where there will be a boy (Johan, played by Mathias Rust) she wants to avoid. Elin\\'s older sister, Jessica, who comes with her, dares her to kiss Agnes, who is rumoured to be a lesbian. Elin fulfills the dare and then runs out with Jessica, only to soon feel guilty for having humiliated Agnes.\\nAfter becoming drunk at the other party, Elin gets sick and throws up. Johan tries to help her and ends up professing his love to her. Elin leaves Johan and the party, only to return to Agnes\\'s house to apologize for how she acted earlier. In doing so, Elin stops Agnes from cutting herself. She even manages to persuade Agnes to return with her to the other party. On the way, Elin shares her real feelings about being trapped in Åmål. She asks Agnes about being a lesbian and believes that their problems could be solved by leaving Åmål and going to Stockholm. On impulse, Elin persuades Agnes to hitchhike to Stockholm, which is a five-hour journey by car. They find a driver who agrees to take them, believing them to be sisters who are visiting their grandmother. While sitting in the back seat, they have their first real kiss. The driver sees them and, shocked at the behaviour of the two \\'sisters\\', orders them to leave the car.\\nElin discovers that she is attracted to Agnes but is afraid to admit it. She proceeds to ignore Agnes and refuses to talk to her. Elin\\'s sister Jessica sees that she is in love and pushes her to figure out who it is. To cover the fact that she is in love with Agnes, Elin lies, pretending to be in love with Johan, and loses her virginity during a short-lived relationship with him. Elin eventually admits her feelings, when, after a climactic scene in a school bathroom, they are forced to \\'out\\' their relationship to the school.\\nThe film ends with Elin and Agnes sitting in Elin\\'s bedroom drinking chocolate milk. Elin explains that she often adds too much chocolate until her milk is nearly black. She must fill another glass with milk and mix it and that her sister Jessica often gets mad that she finishes the chocolate. Elin has the last word saying \"It makes a lot of chocolate milk. But that doesn\\'t matter\".\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 Australian post-apocalyptic dystopian action film co-written, co-produced, and directed by George Miller. Miller collaborated with Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris on the screenplay. The fourth instalment in the Mad Max franchise,[7] it was produced by Village Roadshow Pictures, Kennedy Miller Mitchell, and RatPac-Dune Entertainment and distributed by Roadshow Entertainment in Australia and by Warner Bros. Pictures internationally. The film stars Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, with Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zoë Kravitz, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton in supporting roles. Set in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland where petrol and water are scarce commodities, Fury Road follows Max Rockatansky, who joins forces with Imperator Furiosa against cult leader Immortan Joe and his army, leading to a lengthy road battle.\\nMiller came up with the idea for Fury Road in 1987, but the film spent many years in development hell before pre-production began in 1998. Attempts to shoot the film in the 2000s were delayed numerous times due to the September 11 attacks, the Iraq War, and controversies surrounding star Mel Gibson, leading Miller to recast Gibson\\'s role of Max Rockatansky. Miller decided to pursue the film again in 2007, after the release of his animated comedy film Happy Feet. In 2009, Miller announced that filming would begin in early 2011. Hardy was cast as Max in June 2010, with production planned to begin that November. Principal photography was delayed several more times before it actually began in July 2012. The film wrapped in December 2012, although additional footage was shot in November 2013.\\nFury Road premiered in Los Angeles on 7 May 2015, and was released in Australia on 14 May. It grossed $415.2 million at the worldwide box office, making it the highest-grossing Mad Max film, but is estimated to have incurred overall losses of $20–40 million when all of the advertising and other costs are added to its $154.6–185.1 million production budget.[8] The film was praised by critics for its direction, writing, action sequences, musical score, technical aspects, and performances (particularly those of Hardy and Theron). It won Best Film from the National Board of Review, and was also named one of the top ten films of 2015 by the American Film Institute. The film was nominated for ten awards at the 88th Academy Awards, winning six, and received numerous other accolades.  Retrospectively, the film has been called one of the greatest action films of all time[9][10] and one of the best films of the 2010s.[11][12]\\nFollowing a pay dispute between Warner Bros. and Miller that delayed early efforts to produce follow-up projects, a prequel, Furiosa, is set for release on 24 May 2024, with Miller returning as writer and director.\\n\\nPlot: The world is a post ecocide desert wasteland caused by societal collapse and warfare over resources.[13] Max Rockatansky, a survivor haunted by memories of all the people he failed to protect, is captured and taken to warlord Immortan Joe\\'s Citadel. There, Max is imprisoned and used as a \"blood bag\" for Nux, a sick War Boy. Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa, one of Joe\\'s lieutenants, is sent in the armoured \"War Rig\" to trade produce for petrol and ammunition with two of Joe\\'s allies. When Joe realises his five wives are fleeing in the Rig, he leads his army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of Gas Town and the Bullet Farm. Nux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car, and a battle ensues. Furiosa drives into a sand storm and loses all of her pursuers, except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to blow up the Rig. Max frees himself and restrains Nux, and Furiosa destroys their car.\\nAfter the storm, Max finds Furiosa repairing the Rig, accompanied by Joe\\'s wives: Toast, Capable, the Dag, Cheedo, and Angharad, the last of whom is heavily pregnant with Joe\\'s child. Max tries to steal the Rig, but he does not know the code to bypass the kill switches, so he begrudgingly joins up with Furiosa and the wives. Nux boards the Rig as it leaves and attempts to kill Furiosa. He is overcome and thrown out, and Joe\\'s army picks him up when they pass by. Furiosa drives through a canyon controlled by a biker gang, having arranged to trade fuel for her safe passage, but the gang turns on her when they spot an army approaching, forcing her to flee. The bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe and then pursue the Rig, only stopping when the fuel pod explodes. Joe drives over the blockade in a monster truck and catches up with the Rig, allowing Nux to board and attack Furiosa again, but he trips before reaching the cab. While helping Max, Angharad falls off the Rig and is fatally run over by Joe, who temporarily halts his pursuit.\\nCapable finds Nux hiding in the Rig and consoles him as he laments his failure. After dark, Furiosa and Max slow Joe\\'s forces with mines set in swampland, but Joe\\'s ally, the Bullet Farmer, continues to pursue. The Rig gets stuck, and Nux emerges from hiding to help free it, joining the crew. Furiosa blinds the approaching Bullet Farmer, and Max confronts him and returns with guns and ammunition. In the morning, Furiosa explains to Max that the \"Green Place\" to which they are escaping is an idyllic land she remembers from her childhood. She recognises a familiar landmark and shouts out her history and clan affiliation to a woman on top. The woman summons her all-female clan, the Vuvalini, who recognise Furiosa as one of their own who was kidnapped as a child. Furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland from the previous night was the Green Place, which is now uninhabitable, and there are only seven Vuvalini left. The group, less Max, begins to ride across an immense salt flat, hoping to find a new home. \\nAfter seeing a vision of a child he failed to save,[14][15] Max catches up and convinces the others to return the way they came and take the undefended Citadel, which has ample water and crops. They meet Joe\\'s forces and engage in battle. Five Vuvalini and many members of Joe\\'s forces are killed, and Toast is captured. As they approach the canyon, Joe gets in front of the Rig to slow it. While Max fights Joe\\'s large adult son, Rictus Erectus, Furiosa, though seriously wounded, goes to save Toast and kills Joe. The surviving brides and Vuvalini cross over to Joe\\'s vehicle, and Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig to block the canyon, killing Rictus. Max transfuses his blood to Furiosa, saving her life. Back at the Citadel, the people rejoice upon learning of Joe\\'s death and tear his corpse to pieces. As Max\\'s companions are lifted in triumph to Joe\\'s cliffside fortress, Max exchanges a glance with Furiosa and disappears into the crowd.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'Love Me If You Dare (French: Jeux d\\'enfants, lit.\\u2009\\'Children\\'s games\\') is a 2003 French romantic comedy-drama film directed by Yann Samuell. It stars Guillaume Canet and Marion Cotillard as best friends Julien Janvier and Sophie Kowalsky who begin playing a game of dares as children and find themselves unable to stop as they grow older, even when the game threatens to destroy their lives. \\nThe film had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival on 29 August 2003. It was released theatrically in France by Mars Distribution on 17 September 2003, and in Belgium by Cinéart on 24 September 2003.\\n\\nPlot: The film begins where a little girl, Sophie, is being bullied by other children. Only a bus driver and a boy, Julien, help her collect her books that the others have thrown into a puddle.\\nTo cheer Sophie up, Julien gives her a small tin box, a gift from his fatally ill mother. Because it is important to him, he asks her to lend it back to him from time to time. As Julien wants the box back at the moment he gave it to her, Sophie demands proof of how important it is to him. Julien disengages the handbrake of the bus without hesitation, and the bus full of children rolls down a hill. Their game has begun: the box changes its owner after each completed dare.\\nBetween the son of wealthy Belgian parents and the daughter of poor Polish immigrants a lasting friendship develops. As children, they misbehave in school, wreak havoc on a wedding, and request silly tasks of each other.  As teenagers, their romantic relationships with others suffer as a result of their dares. Meanwhile, the two friends ignore any consequences or punishment during their game.\\nWhile they are always looking for the next kick, a love is slowly evolving between the protagonists. Not wanting to admit it, they divert their attention from it by even more extreme dares.\\nAs young adults, Julien tells Sophie that he wants to get married, only later revealing that he means to someone else.  The climax is reached when Sophie interrupts Julien\\'s wedding, after which he is cast out by his father and Sophie is nearly killed during another game. Julien returns to marry his wife, and Sophie declares that they will not see each other for ten years.\\nTen years pass, and Julien is married with two children.  Sophie has also married her husband, a famous soccer star. A successful Julien admits that he has not forgotten Sophie, though he assumes that she has forgotten him.  On the night of Julien\\'s tenth wedding anniversary, Sophie sends a message to him, indicating that the game is back on.  Julien and Sophie meet for a brief moment in the midst of another dare, yet it is enough to remind Julien that their game is \"better than life itself.\"  After a dramatic accident, Julien and Sophie finally reunite, despite the protestations of their spouses.\\nThe film has two alternate endings, which are shown consecutively. In the first, Julien and Sophie decide as an ultimate dare to finally share their dream together, their \"dream of an eternal love\" – the pair embrace while they stand in a construction pit that is about to be filled with concrete. The couple kiss as they are pulled beneath the cement, and both drown in the sludge. The other ending has the now aged Julien and Sophie spending time together in a garden and carrying on playing their game with milder dares. However, the opening scene of the film (an overhead view of a building site and a pit filled with concrete in which the upper side Julien\\'s tin box rests partially sunk) replays, suggesting that the two friends actually did bury themselves and drown beneath the concrete.\\n'},\n",

It won the Silver Lion for Best Direction at the Venice Film Festival.\\nThe literal translation of the title is actually \"Black pussycat, white tomcat\". The movie characters speak in Romani, Serbian, and Bulgarian - frequently switching among them.\\n\\nPlot: Matko Destanov, a small-time Romani smuggler and profiteer, lives with his teenage son Zare in a ramshackle house by the Danube River in eastern Serbia near the Bulgarian border.  He has plans to steal a whole train of smuggled fuel. To obtain a loan that would subsidize the heist, he visits Grga Pitić, a wheelchair-using old gangster, who is an old friend of Zarije Destanov, Matko\\'s father and Zare\\'s grandfather. Matko plots the details of the job with an ally named Dadan, a rich, fun-living, drug-snorting gangster who has a harem, juggles grenades, and cheats at gambling. However, Dadan double-crosses him and glitches up the deal by giving Matko a drink that is drugged, and carrying out the job while Matko is unconscious.  Matko is unable to repay his loan, so Dadan makes a deal whereby he would forgive the debt if Zare marries Afrodita, Dadan\\'s dwarf sister. However, Zare (17) is in love with Ida (26), a barmaid who works in an establishment run by her Roma grandmother Sujka, and Afrodita is waiting for the man of her dreams. Dadan coerces Afrodita into marrying by dunking her in a well, while Zare first learns of the scheme to marry him off from Ida, who has overheard Dadan and Matko plotting it in the restaurant where she works. Meanwhile, Zare retrieves Zarije from the hospital where he is being kept, with the aid of a gypsy band. Grga Pitić is having problems of his own, as he wants his grandsons, including the 2.00m giant Grga Veliki, to get married.\\nThe two reluctantly endure the wedding ceremony held at Matko\\'s house, which Dadan refuses to postpone despite the sudden apparent death of Zarije. They were not supposed to have a wedding while in mourning, but Dadan decides to delay the death announcement, so Matko and Zare hide Zarije\\'s body in the attic, packed in ice. Ida and Sujka provide the catering for the wedding, and Ida is upset at seeing her beloved married to someone else. However, the bride runs away mid-ceremony, pursued by Dadan, Matko and Dadan\\'s criminal cronies. Meanwhile, Grga Veliki is driving his father and brother to Matko\\'s house so that they may visit Zarije\\'s grave (Grga Pitić and Zarije  old friends). The fleeing bride stumbles across Grga Veliki, and the couple fall instantly in love. Grga Pitić arrives on the scene, after his wheelchair had fallen out the back of the truck and rolled downhill, and he is delighted that Grga Veliki has found his mate. The old gangster forces Dadan, who had once worked for him, to accept the match.\\nThe groom conspires with Sujka and Ida to bring Dadan down a peg, and rigs the outhouse so that the seat will come apart. While the preparations for the wedding ceremony of Afrodita and Grga Veliki are being conducted, Matko and Dadan pass the time by playing dice, with Dadan cheating. Sujka comes in during the game, and serves the unsuspecting Dadan a drink spiked with a laxative. Grga Pitić apparently dies, and Dadan and Matko hide his body in the attic, where Zarije\\'s body is also hidden. However, the two corpses soon both come back to life; they were not dead after all. They are surprised to find themselves together, as they had not seen each other for 25 years and each had thought the other was dead. During the ceremony, Dadan starts to feel uncomfortable and rushes into the outhouse, only to fall into the manure. His harem and cronies desert him, and as he tries to clean himself off on a goose, only Matko remains loyal, and he provides Dadan with a shower from the garden hose. Zare grabs the wedding official at gunpoint and orders him to solemnize his marriage with his sweetheart, Ida, and the two sail off together on a riverboat set for Bulgaria with a fistful of cash stashed in his grandfather\\'s accordion, the blessing of their respective grandparents and, as witnesses, a black cat and a white cat.\\n'},\n",

Outside, an explosive booby trap kills two police officers. Following the raid, Kate is recommended for and joins a Joint Task Force overseen by CIA Officer Matt Graver and the secretive Alejandro Gillick, a Mexican ex-prosecutor turned CIA-trained assassin. Their mission is to flush out and apprehend Sonora lieutenant Manuel Díaz, currently operating hidden in the US.\\nThe team, which includes Delta Force operators, Deputy US Marshals, and CIA personnel, travels to Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, to extradite Díaz's brother, Guillermo. While crossing the El Paso–Juárez border, the team is ambushed by low-level cartel hitmen, whom the Americans swiftly kill. During the gunfight, Kate is forced to kill a Federal Police officer, and is left visibly disturbed by the violence. Back in the U.S., Alejandro tortures Guillermo and learns that the cartel uses a tunnel near Nogales, Sonora, to smuggle drugs. Meanwhile, Kate confronts Matt, who reveals that the real mission is to disrupt Díaz's drug operations so he can lead them to his boss, drug lord Fausto Alarcón. Unnerved, Kate asks Reggie to join her for support.\\nThe task force raids a bank used to launder Díaz's money. After finding financial evidence, Kate and Reggie want to start a legal case against Díaz but are ordered to stand down to avoid jeopardizing the operation. At a bar, Reggie introduces Kate to Ted, a Phoenix Police officer. Kate and Ted become intimate at her apartment, but she realizes Ted is working with the cartel. In the ensuing struggle, Ted begins to strangle Kate before Alejandro appears and subdues him. Alejandro and Matt brutally beat Ted to coerce him into revealing the names of other officers working for Díaz.\\nAfter the team learns that Díaz has been recalled to Mexico, they prepare to raid the tunnel near Nogales. Matt reveals to Kate and Reggie that their involvement is a technical necessity as the CIA is not allowed to operate alone within US borders. An angered Reggie tells Kate they should leave, but she insists on staying to learn about the mission's true purpose. As a gunfight with the cartel begins, Kate follows Alejandro into Mexico. She sees him abduct Silvio, a corrupt Sonora police officer working as one of Díaz's drug mules. Kate attempts to arrest Alejandro, but he shoots her in her Kevlar vest to subdue her before driving away with Silvio at gunpoint. On the U.S. side of the border, Kate confronts Matt, who explains the mission is part of a broader operation to consolidate the cartels into a single entity that the U.S. can more easily control. Alejandro, who previously worked for the Medellín Cartel, was hired to assassinate Alarcón, the man responsible for ordering the murder of Alejandro's wife and daughter when he was a prosecutor in Juárez. Alejandro kills Silvio after he stops Díaz's vehicle and forces Díaz to drive to Alarcón's estate. On arrival, he quickly kills Díaz and Alarcón's guards; finding the family seated to dinner, he kills Alarcón's wife and two sons, and then Alarcón.\\nThe next day, Alejandro appears in Kate's apartment and forces her at gunpoint to sign a statement attesting that the entire operation was legal. As he leaves, she aims her pistol at him and Alejandro turns to face her, but she cannot bring herself to pull the trigger.

He outmaneuvers a small group of marauders led by the unhinged biker Wez using his driving skills and a sawed-off shotgun and gets some petrol from a wrecked semi-truck.\\nLater, Max tries collecting an apparently abandoned gyrocopter\\'s fuel, but is ambushed by the pilot. Max overpowers the man with his dog\\'s help, sparing his life in return for being led to a working oil refinery the pilot has discovered. They arrive during the daily attack on the facility by a motley motorised gang, whose members include Wez.\\nThe next day, Max witnesses several cars leave the besieged compound and get chased down by marauders. He rescues Nathan, the sole survivor of one car, and strikes a deal to return him to the complex in exchange for fuel, but the man dies shortly after Max gets him back, and the leader of the settlers, Papagallo, says the deal died with Nathan. The settlers are about to confiscate Max\\'s car and cast him out of their compound when the marauders return to parley. A feral child who lives in the refinery compound kills Wez\\'s partner with a metal boomerang and Wez wants revenge, but the gang\\'s leader, a muscular masked man called \"Lord Humungus\", offers to spare the settlers\\' lives in exchange for their fuel supply and leaves for the day. However, several of the settlers suspect Humungus has no intention of letting them survive. \\nWith the settlers split about what to do, Max offers his own deal: he will bring them the semi-truck he saw earlier so they can try to haul away their tanker full of oil, if they return his car and give him as much fuel as he can carry. The settlers agree to let him try, and that night Max sneaks past the marauders on foot carrying fuel for the truck. He encounters the Gyro Captain and forces the man to fly him to the truck, which he is able to get started. It is somewhat damaged as Max passes through the marauders\\' encampment on the way back to the refinery, but he makes it, followed by the gyrocopter.\\nMax refuses Papagallo\\'s entreaty to accompany the settlers to a fabled northern paradise,[b] opting instead to collect his fuel and leave. Wez catches him using Humungus\\'s nitrous oxide-equipped vehicle and causes him to crash. A Marauder kills Max\\'s dog and is about to kill the seriously-injured Max when a Marauder named Toadie attempts to siphon the fuel from the Pursuit Special\\'s tanks, triggering the car to self-destruct. Left for dead, Max is rescued by the Gyro Captain and returned to the compound.\\nDespite his injuries, Max insists on driving the repaired truck during the escape. His support consists of the Gyro Captain, Papagallo in a separate vehicle, three of the settlers on the outside of the armoured tanker, and the Feral Kid, who jumps on the truck as it is leaving. The marauders pursue the tanker, allowing the remaining settlers to flee their compound in a caravan of smaller vehicles after rigging the refinery to explode.\\nPapagallo and the three settlers are killed and the Gyro Captain is shot down. Max turns the truck around and, as he is fighting with Wez, Humungus collides with the truck head on, killing Wez and himself. The truck rolls off the road and the surviving marauders survey the scene, only to abandon their chase when they see the tanker leaking sand and not gas. As Max carries the Feral Kid from the wrecked tanker, he inspects the sand pouring out. The Gyro Captain drives up and the two share a grin as Max realizes the tanker had been a diversion the whole time. They rendezvous with the settlers, who transported the fuel in oil drums inside their vehicles.\\nThe Gyro Captain succeeds Papagallo as leader of the settlers and takes them north. The Feral Kid, revealing himself as the film\\'s narrator, relates that he became \"Chief of the Great Northern Tribe\" when he grew up.

       "  'Description': 'Talk to Her (Spanish: Hable con ella) is a 2002 Spanish drama film written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar, and starring Javier Cámara, Darío Grandinetti, Leonor Watling, Geraldine Chaplin, and Rosario Flores. The film follows two men who form an unlikely friendship as they care for two women who are both in comas.\\nThe film was a critical and commercial success, winning the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language and the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film while Almodóvar won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. It is generally regarded as one of the best films of the 2000s.[2]\\n\\nPlot: The story unfolds in flashbacks, giving details of two separate relationships that become intertwined.\\nAt a performance of Café Müller, a dance-theatre piece by Pina Bausch, Benigno Martín and Marco Zuluaga are seated next to each other. They are strangers, but Benigno notices the tears on Marco\\'s face at one point.\\nMarco is a journalist and travel writer who sees a TV interview with Lydia González, a famous matador. He thinks that an article about her would be interesting and contacts her in a bar, where she asks him to take her home. The news that she has broken up with her boyfriend \"el Niño de Valencia\", another matador, has been all over the tabloids. When Marco confesses that he is a journalist who knows nothing about bullfighting, she becomes angry and abruptly exits his car outside her house. He starts to drive off but stops when he hears a scream from inside her house. Lydia rushes out and gets into his car: Marco goes inside to kill a snake, an act that leaves him weeping. They become friends and, later on, lovers. Marco attends a wedding and is surprised to see Lydia there. The wedding is that of Marco\\'s former fiancée, Ángela, who had the same phobia of snakes as Lydia. Lydia says that she has something important to say, but she prefers to wait until after the bullfight that afternoon, during which she is gored and becomes comatose. Marco remains by her side at the hospital and befriends Benigno, who recognizes him from the theatre performance. A doctor tells Marco that there is no reason for him to remain hopeful about Lydia.\\nBenigno is obsessed with Alicia Roncero, a beautiful dancer whom he watches practicing in the studio that he can see into from the apartment where he lives with his invalid mother. To care for her, he became a nurse and a beautician. After his mother dies, he finds the courage to talk to Alicia when she drops her wallet on the street. As they walk to her house, she talks about dancing and her enjoyment of silent black and white films. When she enters her building, Benigno notices that it is also the office of Dr. Roncero, a psychiatrist. As a ruse to gain access to Alicia\\'s apartment, Benigno makes an appointment to see the doctor. In response to the doctor\\'s questions, Benigno talks about the years he cared for his mother and says that he is lonely and a virgin. Afterward, a shocked Alicia sees him leaving her room, from which he has taken a hair clip. That night she is struck by a car and becomes comatose. In the hospital, where Benigno is assigned to care for Alicia, he talks to her as if she were awake and brings her dancing and silent film mementos. He tells Marco that he should talk to Lydia because, even when in a coma, women understand men\\'s problems. In response to Dr. Roncero\\'s questioning, Benigno says that he is gay, presumably so that the doctor will not be suspicious of his intimate care of Alicia.\\n\"El Niño de Valencia\", whom Marco finds in Lydia\\'s room one day, tells Marco that Lydia and he had reconciled, that before the goring incident she intended to tell Marco that. He also says that, now that he has recovered from his own injuries, he should be the one attending to Lydia. Marco goes into Alicia\\'s room and starts opening his heart to her. When Benigno appears, he tells Marco that he always thought Marco and Lydia would separate. A nurse expresses concern that Alicia has not had a period in two months and appears bloated. In the hospital parking lot, Benigno tells Marco of his desire to marry Alicia. Marco is taken aback, pointing out that Alicia cannot express her will in any way. Benigno remains unpersuaded.\\nThe hospital staff discover that Alicia is pregnant because she was raped. Further investigation reveals that her chart does not indicate her missed period. Benigno admits to falsifying the chart and claims that he did this so as not to alarm anyone, as other comatose patients have also missed their periods. Another orderly reports having overheard Benigno\\'s conversation with Marco about wanting to marry Alicia.\\nUnaware of Alicia\\'s pregnancy, Marco leaves for Jordan to write a travel book. Months later, he reads in a newspaper that Lydia has died without awakening from her coma. When he calls the hospital to talk to Benigno, a nurse tells him that Benigno is in prison for Alicia\\'s rape. Benigno, who has been denied information about Alicia since his imprisonment, asks Marco to find out what has happened to her. Marco stays in Benigno\\'s apartment, from which he sees Alicia in the dance studio doing rehab exercises with her teacher, Katrina. From Benigno\\'s lawyer, Marco learns that Alicia had a stillborn baby. The lawyer urges him not to tell Benigno about the baby or Alicia\\'s recovery.\\nMarco receives a voicemail from Benigno saying that he cannot live without Alicia and has decided to \"take off.” Marco rushes to the prison, where Benigno has left him a farewell letter: Marco visits Benigno\\'s grave and tells him about the stillbirth and Alicia’s recovery.\\nThe film ends in the theatre where it began, with Alicia and Katrina sitting a few rows behind Marco at the dance performance. Marco is seen turning back to look at a smiling Alicia and, echoing a caption that had appeared for the couples \"Marco y Lydia\" and \"Benigno y Alicia,\" the words “Marco y Alicia” appear on the screen.\\n'},\n",

It is the sequel to the 2009 film The Hangover and the second installment in The Hangover trilogy. Directed by Todd Phillips, who co-wrote the script with Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong, the film stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Ken Jeong, Jeffrey Tambor, Justin Bartha, and Paul Giamatti.\\nIt tells the story of Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug as they travel to Thailand for Stu's wedding. After the bachelor party in Las Vegas, Stu takes no chances and opts for a safe, subdued pre-wedding brunch. Things do not go as planned, resulting in another bad hangover with no memories of the previous night.\\nDevelopment began in April 2009, two months before The Hangover was released. The principal actors were cast in March 2010 to reprise their roles from the first film. Production began in October 2010, in Ontario, California, before moving on location in Thailand. The film was released on May 26, 2011, and became the highest-grossing R-rated comedy during its theatrical run, but unlike the first film, The Hangover Part II received mixed reviews. \\nA third and final installment, The Hangover Part III, was released on May 23, 2013.[3]\\n\\nPlot: Two years after the events in Las Vegas, Stu Price is preparing to travel to Thailand for his upcoming wedding to Lauren, his recent fiancée. In order to avoid the events in Las Vegas, Stu initially doesn't allow his three best friends, Doug Billings, Phil Wenneck and especially Alan Garner to accompany him. He also hosts his bachelor party at a breakfast restaurant with Phil and Doug with Alan not being there due to Stu intentionally not inviting him. After this and Tracy asking her husband Doug to convince Stu to allow her brother Alan to accompany them to Thailand, Stu allows his friends (including Alan), Tracy and Phil's wife Stephanie to go with him. At the airport and much to Alan's dismay, they are joined by Lauren's younger brother, a Stanford University scholar named Teddy. At the rehearsal dinner, Lauren's father reveals his disapproval of Stu during a toast. Later that night, Stu hesitantly joins Phil, Doug, Alan and Teddy for a beer. Sitting at a campfire and roasting marshmallows, the group toast to Stu and Lauren's future happiness.\\nThe next day, Phil, Stu and Alan awaken in a dilapidated hotel room in Bangkok with no memory of how they got there. Stu has a face tattoo similar to Mike Tyson's and Alan's head is completely shaved. They meet a chain-smoking capuchin monkey and discover that their old 'friend', Chinese gangster Leslie Chow, followed them to Thailand on Alan's invitation. They cannot find Teddy, discovering only his severed finger. Chow begins to relay the events of the prior night, but he seemingly dies after snorting a line of cocaine. Panicked, the trio disposes of Chow's body in the hotel's ice box.\\nThrough a tip from Doug (who left the campfire earlier and stayed at the resort), they go to a police station to pick up Teddy, but are given a wheelchair containing an elderly Buddhist monk. He refuses to reveal anything, having taken a vow of silence. After finding a business card, they travel to the smoldering ruins of the business.\\nThey enter a nearby tattoo parlor where Stu got his tattoo, and they learn that they started a fight that escalated into a riot. The trio returns the monk to his temple, where they are encouraged by the head monk to meditate. Alan manages to recall that they had been at a strip club, where they learn that Stu engaged in sexual intercourse with a transsexual woman. Upon exiting, the trio is attacked by two Russian mobsters who take the monkey, and one shoots Phil in his arm.\\nAfter Phil is treated at a clinic, Alan confesses that he had drugged some of the marshmallows from the previous night with muscle relaxers and his ADHD medication in order to sedate Teddy, as he feared the others were going to replace him, but accidentally mixed up the bags. Phil and Stu become furious that Alan drugged them again. Stu blames Alan for ruining his life and attacks him, but Phil breaks it up and tells them that they have to stick together. They notice something on Alan's stomach: an address and a time for a meeting. They meet a gangster named Kingsley, who demands Chow's bank account password by the following morning in exchange for Teddy. They return to the hotel to try to find Chow's password, only to discover that he is still alive. They steal the monkey, who had the code given to him and put inside his vest for safe-keeping by Chow, back from the Russian mobsters through a violent car chase, during which the monkey is shot and injured.\\nAfter taking the code and leaving the monkey outside a veterinary clinic, the group completes the deal with Kingsley the next morning. Interpol agents appear and arrest Chow. Kingsley turns out to be an undercover agent, who tells the trio that he does not actually know where Teddy is.\\nDesperate, Phil calls Doug's wife Tracy to tell her they cannot find Teddy. Stu decides to call off the wedding, live in Bangkok and say that Teddy died. During a rolling blackout, Stu realizes where Teddy is. The trio rushes back to the hotel to find Teddy who is in the elevator (though is still missing a finger). Teddy had woken up earlier than the others, but became trapped after the power went out when he went to get ice for his finger. The four use Chow's speedboat to travel back to the wedding reception.\\nArriving just as Lauren's father is about to cancel the wedding, Stu makes a defiant speech, and rejects being a boring dentist and instead insists he is quite wild. Impressed, Lauren's father gives the couple his blessing. Alan presents Stu with a special gift at the reception: a musical guest performance by Mike Tyson. Teddy later discovers that he had taken many pictures during the night on his cell phone before the battery died. The group, along with Tyson, agree to look at the pictures together once before deleting them.\\n\"},\n",

       "  'Description': 'Raise the Red Lantern is a 1991 film directed by Zhang Yimou and starring Gong Li. It is an adaptation by Ni Zhen\\xa0[zh] of the 1990 novella Raise the Red Lantern (originally Wives and Concubines) by Su Tong. The film was later adapted into an acclaimed ballet of the same title by the National Ballet of China, also directed by Zhang.\\nSet in the 1920s, the film tells the story of a young woman who becomes the fourth wife of a wealthy man during the Warlord Era. It is noted for its opulent visuals and sumptuous use of colours.  The film was shot in the Qiao Family Compound near the ancient city of Pingyao, in Shanxi Province.\\n\\nPlot: The film is set in the 1920s Republican. Nineteen-year-old Songlian (played by Gong Li), an educated woman whose father has recently died and left the family bankrupt, is forced by her stepmother to marry into the wealthy Chen family, becoming the fourth wife or, as she is referred to, the Fourth Mistress (Sì Tàitai) of the household. Arriving at the palatial abode, she is at first treated like royalty, receiving sensuous foot massages and brightly lit red lanterns, as well as a visit from her husband, Master Chen (Ma Jingwu), the master of the house, whose face is never clearly shown.\\nSonglian soon discovers, however, that not all the wives in the household receive the same luxurious treatment. In fact, the master decides on a daily basis the wife with whom he will spend the night; whomever he chooses gets her lanterns lit, receives the foot massage, gets her choice of menu items at mealtime, and gets the most attention and respect from the servants. Pitted in constant competition against each other, the three wives are continually vying for their husband\\'s attention.\\nThe First Mistress, Yuru (Jin Shuyuan), appears to be nearly as old as the master himself. Having borne a son decades earlier, she seems resigned to live out her life as forgotten, always passed over in favor of the younger women. The Second Mistress, Zhuoyun (Zhuóyún, Cao Cuifen), befriends Songlian, complimenting her youth and beauty, and giving her expensive silk as a gift; she also warns her about the Third Mistress, Meishan (Méishan, He Saifei), a former opera singer who is spoiled and who becomes unable to cope with no longer being the youngest and most favored of the master\\'s playthings. As time passes, though, Songlian learns that it is really Zhuoyun, the Second Mistress, who is not to be trusted; she is subsequently described as having the face of the Buddha, yet possessing the heart of a scorpion. She also has to deal with her personal maid, Yan\\'er (Yàn\\'ér, played by Kong Lin), who hates her and dreams of being married after a few brief flings with the Master.\\nSonglian feigns pregnancy, attempting to garner the majority of the master\\'s time and, at the same time, attempting to become actually pregnant. Zhuoyun, however, is in league with Yan\\'er who finds and reveals a pair of bloodied undergarments, suggesting that Songlian had recently had her period, and discovers the pregnancy is a fraud.\\nZhuoyun summons the family physician, feigning concern for Songlian\\'s \"pregnancy\". Doctor Gao (Gao-yisheng, Cui Zhigang), who is secretly having an illicit affair with Third Mistress Meishan, examines Songlian and determines the pregnancy to be a sham. Infuriated, the master orders Songlian\\'s lanterns covered with thick black canvas bags indefinitely. Blaming the sequence of events on Yan\\'er, Songlian reveals to the house that Yan\\'er\\'s room is filled with lit red lanterns, showing that Yan\\'er dreams of becoming a mistress instead of a lowly servant; it is suggested earlier that Yan\\'er is in love with the master and has even slept with him in the Fourth Mistress\\' bed.\\nYan\\'er is punished by having the lanterns burned while she kneels in the snow, watching as they smolder. In an act of defiance, Yan\\'er refuses to humble herself or apologize, and thus remains kneeling in the snow throughout the night until she collapses. Yan\\'er falls sick and ultimately dies after being taken to the hospital. One of the servants tells Songlian that her former maid died with her mistress\\'s name on her lips. Songlian, who had briefly attended university before the passing of her father and being forced into marriage, comes to the conclusion that she is happier in solitude; she eventually sees the competition between the women as a useless endeavour, as each woman is merely a \"robe\" that the master may wear and discard at his discretion.\\nAs Songlian retreats further into her solitude, she begins speaking of suicide; she reasons that dying is a better fate than being a wife in the Chen household. On her twentieth birthday, severely intoxicated and despondent over her bitter fate, Songlian inadvertently blurts out the details of the love affair between Meishan and Doctor Gao to Zhuoyun, who later catches the adulterous couple together. Following the old customs and traditions, Meishan is dragged to a lone room (also known as the room of death earlier on) on the roof of the estate and is hanged to death by the master\\'s servants.\\nSonglian, already in agony due to the fruitlessness of her life, witnesses the entire episode and is emotionally traumatized. The following summer, after the Master\\'s marriage to yet another concubine, Songlian is shown wandering the compound in her old schoolgirl clothes, appearing to have gone completely insane.\\n'},\n",

It chronicles the troubled relationships amongst two Peking opera actors and lifelong friends Cheng Dieyi (Cheung) and Duan Xiaolou (Zhang), and Xiaolou\\'s wife Juxian (Gong).\\nThe film\\'s themes include confusion of identity and blurred lines between real life and the stage, portrayed by the revered opera actor Dieyi, whose unrequited love for Xiaolou persists throughout. Commentators also noted themes of political and societal disturbances in 20th-century China, which is typical of the Chinese Fifth Generation cinema.\\nFarewell My Concubine premiered on January 1, 1993, in Hong Kong.

While allowing a premiere in Beijing but forbidding release in other cities, the government objected to the representation of homosexuality, the suicide of a leading character and a description of the turmoil during the Communist period in China.[2]\\nThe film was allowed to resume public showings in September 1993, less than a year after its original release. Upon its return the Chinese censors had made numerous cuts, removing 14 minutes. Chinese officials felt that a re-release as opposed to maintaining a full ban would silence ever-growing international backlash and also help their bid to host the Olympic games in Beijing in 2000.[3][4]\\nFarewell My Concubine is considered one of the landmark films of the Fifth Generation movement that brought Chinese film directors to world attention.[5][6] In 2005, the film was selected as one of the \"100 Best Films in Global History\" by Time magazine.\\n\\nPlot: In the winter of 1924, Douzi, a boy with feminine features, is abandoned by his prostitute mother at an all-boys Peking opera troupe supervised by Master Guan.

Upon returning, they find the whole troupe being punished for their desertion. On seeing Shitou being beaten, Douzi takes responsibility for the escape so the masters will hit him instead, and he is beaten severely, stopping only when it is discovered that Laizi has hanged himself.\\nNa Kun, an agent who provides funding for opera, visits the troupe seeking potential actors. When Douzi repeats his previous mistake in front of Na, Shitou commands him to start over. Douzi finally whispers, \"I am by nature a girl, not a boy\".

Starring Gael García Bernal, Fele Martínez, Daniel Giménez Cacho, Lluís Homar and Francisco Boira, the film focuses on two reunited childhood friends and lovers caught up in a stylised murder mystery. Along with metafiction, sexual abuse by Catholic priests, transsexuality and drug use are also important themes and devices in the plot. The film received an NC-17 rating in the United States for a depiction of homosexual sex.\\nThe film was released on 19 March 2004 in Spain and 10 September 2004 in Mexico. It was also screened at many international film festivals such as Cannes, New York, Moscow and Toronto before its US release on 19 November 2004. The film received critical acclaim, and was seen as a return to Almodovar\\'s dark stage, placing it alongside films such as Matador (1986) and Law of Desire (1987).\\n\\nPlot: In 1980 Madrid, young film director Enrique Goded is looking for his next project when he receives the unexpected visit of an actor looking for work. The actor claims to be Enrique\\'s boarding school friend and first love, Ignacio Rodriguez. Ignacio, who is now using the name Ángel Andrade, has brought a short story titled \"The Visit\", hoping that Enrique would be interested in making a film out of it and give him the starring role. Enrique is intrigued since \"The Visit\" describes their time together at the Catholic boarding school and it also includes a fictionalized account of their reunion many years later as adults.\\n\"The Visit\" is set in 1977. It tells the story of a transgender drag queen with the stage name Zahara, whose birth name is Ignacio. Zahara plans to rob a drunken admirer but discovers that the man is her boyhood lover Enrique. Next she visits her old school and confronts Father Manolo, who abused her when she was a boy. She demands one million pesetas from him in exchange for halting publication of her story \"The Visit\". The story is set in a Catholic boarding school for boys in 1964. At the school, Ignacio, a young boy with a beautiful singing voice, is the object of lust of Father Manolo, the school principal and literature teacher. Ignacio falls in love with a young Enrique, and the two go the local cinema and grope each other. Manolo discovers them together that night. Although Ignacio allows Manolo to molest him in exchange for not punishing Enrique, he expels him nonetheless.\\nEnrique wants to adapt the story but balks at Ángel\\'s condition to be cast as Zahara, feeling that the Ignacio whom he loved and the Ignacio of today are totally different people. He drives to see Ignacio\\'s mother in Ortigueira, Galicia and learns that the real Ignacio has been dead for four years and that the man who came to his office is actually Ignacio\\'s younger brother, Juan. Enrique\\'s interest is piqued, and he decides to do the film with Juan in the role of Ignacio to find out what drives Juan. Enrique and Ángel start a relationship, and Enrique revises the script so that it ends with Father Manolo, whom Ignacio was trying to blackmail to get money for sex reassignment surgery, having Ignacio murdered. When the scene is shot, Ángel breaks out in tears unexpectedly.\\nThe film set is visited by Manuel Berenguer, who is the real Father Manolo, who has resigned from Church duty. Berenguer confesses to Enrique that the new ending of the film is not far from the truth: the real Ignacio blackmailed Berenguer, who somehow managed to scratch together the money but also took an interest in Ignacio\\'s younger brother, Juan. Juan and Manolo started a relationship and after a while realized they both wanted to see Ignacio dead. Juan scored some very pure heroin, so that his brother would die by overdose after shooting up. After the crime, the relationship disintegrates; Berenguer wants to continue the relationship with Juan, but Juan is uninterested. Berenguer claims that he will never let Juan go, and Juan threatens to kill him if Berenguer continues to pursue him. Berenguer attempts to blackmail Juan for his part in the murder of Ignacio. Enrique is shocked and not at all interested in Juan\\'s weak vindications for what he did to his brother. Finally, before he leaves, Juan gives Enrique a piece of paper: a letter to Enrique that Ignacio was in the middle of typing when he died reading \"I think I have succeeded...\"\\nAn epilogue states that after the release of the film Juan and Enrique both achieved great success, although Juan was later relegated to television acting after his career declined in the 1990s and killed Berenguer in a hit-and-run because of his continued blackmailing of him.\\n'},\n",

He visits the museum and learns most of the exhibits will be moved to the Smithsonian Institution archives and replaced with holographic displays, but the Tablet of Ahkmenrah will stay behind, leaving the departing exhibits without the ability to come to life at night.\\nLater, Larry receives a panicked phone call from miniature cowboy Jedediah, who explains that Dexter the monkey brought the tablet to the Smithsonian, where they are under attack by Ahkmenrah's older brother Kahmunrah. Larry travels to Washington, DC and poses as a night guard to sneak into the archives, where he finds his friends trapped by Kahmunrah, who plans to use the tablet's powers to conquer the world.\\nAided by General George A. Custer, who is captured, Larry is joined by Amelia Earhart. They evade Kahmunrah's soldiers inside the photograph of V-J Day in Times Square, leading Kahmunrah to enlist Ivan the Terrible, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Al Capone to retrieve the tablet. Larry is captured, but when the tablet fails to open the Gate of the Underworld, Kahmunrah traps Jedediah in an hourglass and gives Larry one hour to decipher the tablet's combination.\\nAmelia has fallen in love with Larry, and the statue of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial mistakes them for a couple as they reach the National Air and Space Museum. They encounter various figures from the history of flight, including the Wright brothers, a squadron of Tuskegee Airmen, and Able the space monkey, while a group of Albert Einstein bobbleheads explain that the combination is the value of pi. Napoleon, Ivan, and Capone's troops arrive, prompting Larry and Amelia to escape in the Wright Flyer.\\nThey crash into the Smithsonian, where Kahmunrah uses the combination to open the gate and summon an army of Horus warriors. Miniature Roman general Octavius arrives with the statue of Lincoln, frightening the warriors back to the Underworld, and Amelia gathers an army of allies including Larry's friends and Custer, leading to a climactic battle. Larry helps Custer overcome his fear of repeating the Battle of Little Big Horn, while Octavius rescues Jedediah, and Larry recovers the tablet and turns Capone, Bonaparte, and Ivan against each other. Armed with his flashlight, Larry duels a khopesh-wielding Kahmunrah as Amelia reopens the gate, allowing Larry to banish Kahmunrah to the Underworld.\\nFlying Larry and the New York exhibits home, Amelia reveals that she knows she is only a wax figure of the real aviator, and she and Larry share a kiss before she takes off back to the Smithsonian. Two months later, Larry has sold his company and made an anonymous donation to renovate the Natural History Museum and extend its nighttime visiting hours when the exhibits are alive; believed to be animatronics and hired reenactors, the exhibits are now able to interact with visitors at night. Back in his old job as night guard, Larry hits it off with a visitor named Tess, who bears a striking resemblance to Amelia.\\n\"},\n",

There is little dialogue; much of the narrative is conveyed through song and pantomime. It tells the story of Madame Souza, an elderly woman who goes on a quest to rescue her grandson Champion, a Tour de France cyclist, who has been kidnapped by the French mafia for gambling purposes and taken to the city of Belleville (an amalgam of Paris, New York City, Montreal and Quebec City[5]). She is accompanied by Champion\\'s loyal and obese hound, Bruno, and joined by the Triplets of Belleville, music hall singers from the 1930s, whom she meets in the city.\\nThe film was highly praised by audiences and critics for its unique style of animation and has since gained a cult following.[6] The film was nominated for two Academy Awards—Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song for \"Belleville Rendez-vous\". It was also screened out of competition (hors concours) at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival.[7]\\n\\nPlot: In France, Madame Souza raises her grandson Champion, a melancholy orphan. Both watch an old variety show on television featuring a trio of singers, the Triplets of Belleville (Rose, Violette, and Blanche). When the program is interrupted, Souza asks Champion if the \"film\" is finished. The listless Champion does not reply and instead changes the channel to a piano concert. Souza, upon noticing Champion\\'s interest in the music, pulls out an old piano and tries to attract Champion\\'s attention by playing a scale, but Champion remains indifferent. Souza deduces that Champion is lonely and buys him a dog, Bruno. Neither Bruno nor an electric train set succeed in lifting Champion\\'s spirits.\\nWhile tidying Champion\\'s room, Souza discovers a book filled with photos of cyclists. She decides to buy Champion a tricycle, which finally allows Champion to indulge in his passion. After a few years of training, Champion competes in the Tour de France, but finds himself left behind in his exhaustion, and he is kidnapped by a pair of mobsters, who take him and two other contestants across the Atlantic. Souza pursues Champion on a pedalo to Belleville.\\nArriving in the United States, Souza finds herself penniless, but meets the elderly Triplets of Belleville, Rose, Violette and Blanche. The Triplets take Souza into their apartment, and after a peculiar dinner, they allow her to participate as a musician in one of their shows. During the show, Souza spots the mobsters who kidnapped Champion. With the help of the Triplets, Souza pursues the men and rescues her grandson after a Homeric chase against the mob and its godfather. In a flashforward, an older Champion watches the TV again showing their adventure when they are leaving the city and imagines Souza asking once more if the film is finished. Champion turns to the empty couch seat next to him and says \"It\\'s over, grandma\".\\nIn a humorous post-credits scene, the boatman who rented Souza the pedalo is seen waiting expectantly for his vessel to return.\\n'},\n",

He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela for research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. Composer Michael Giacchino composed the film's score.

He concocts a plan to have a day off by tricking the farmer into going back to sleep by counting his sheep repeatedly. However, the caravan in which they put the farmer to bed accidentally rolls away, taking him into a city. Bitzer, the farmer\\'s dog, chases after him. The farmer receives a blow to the head and is taken to a hospital, where he is diagnosed with amnesia.

Among the group is young Cecil \"C.J.\" Fredericks, who discovers the Tablet of Ahkmenrah. As the team packs up the artifacts due to an incoming sandstorm, the locals warn them about removing the tablet from the tomb, saying \"the end will come.\"\\nSeventy-six years later in New York City, five years after the events of the previous film, Larry Daley remains the night guard of the Museum of Natural History. He and the other exhibits are hosting an event to help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. As Larry makes sure everything is ready, the other exhibits inform him that the museum commissioned a new Neanderthal model resembling Larry. The new Neanderthal calls himself Laaa and considers Larry his father. Later, Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet has a mysterious corrosion. As the corrosion spreads, the exhibits act abnormally and cause massive chaos at the planetarium. After calming the situation, Larry, frustrated, returns home to find his teenage son Nick throwing a party.\\nTo discover what is happening to the tablet, Larry reunites with now-retired Cecil, a member of the expedition who discovered the tomb. Cecil remembers \"the end will come\" prophecy and realizes it refers to the tablet\\'s magic ending and the exhibits becoming lifeless. Cecil says Ahkmenrah\\'s parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet\\'s power, but that they are in the British Museum. Larry convinces museum curator Dr. McPhee, who was fired due to the planetarium incident, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, although McPhee believes the magic is just clever special effects. Larry and Nick travel to the U.K. and go to the British Museum, bypassing the night guard Tilly. Larry discovers that some of the American exhibits have stowed away with Ahkmenrah: Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, miniatures Jedediah and Octavius, Dexter the capuchin monkey, and Laaa. As Larry and the others search the museum, the tablet brings the British exhibits to life.\\nThe group is joined by a wax figure of Sir Lancelot, who helps fight off aggressive museum exhibits like a Triceratops skeleton and a Xiangliu statue. The tablet\\'s corrosion worsens, and the American exhibits begin experiencing side-effects such as stiffening limbs and memory reversion. The group finds Ahkmenrah\\'s parents. They learn the tablet\\'s power can be regenerated by moonlight, since it is empowered through the magic of Khonsu. Lancelot steals the tablet, mistaking it for the Holy Grail, and prepares to leave for Camelot. Tilly locks Larry and Laaa in the employee break room, but Attila helps them escape. Laaa remains behind to distract Tilly; they become attracted to each other.\\nLancelot crashes the musical Camelot starring Hugh Jackman and Alice Eve and is stunned to realize that unlike the other exhibits, Lancelot and Camelot are not real. Larry and the others chase Lancelot to the theatre\\'s roof, where the corrosion almost consumes the entire tablet, turning the exhibits back into their lifeless forms. The group tells Lancelot that although Camelot never existed, he can have a life. Lancelot gives the tablet back, allowing Larry to straighten the pieces as the moonlight restores the tablet\\'s power and the exhibits. As the American exhibits prepare to return home, they decide that Ahkmenrah and his tablet should stay at the London Museum with his parents, even though this means the New York exhibits will no longer come to life. Larry is upset, but they all inform him that they are at peace with their unanimous decision. Ahkmenrah thanks Larry for reuniting him with his family, and the exhibits go home. Back in New York, Larry spends some final moments with his friends and says goodbye to them before the sun rises, and then he leaves the museum for the last time.\\nThree years later, Larry now works as a school teacher after the museum rehired McPhee. Tilly, the new night guard, brings a traveling exhibit to New York in a collaboration with the Museum of Natural History. In McPhee\\'s office, Tilly hands the tablet to McPhee, showing him its power and allowing the exhibits to awaken again as they throw a huge party.

The film received seven awards and eight nominations worldwide.[5]\\nIn August 2021,[6] The Criterion Collection announced a re-release of the film, in a 2K remaster together with interviews, deleted scenes, audio commentary and an essay by novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen.[7]\\n\\nPlot: A small, mid-20th century social-service-style structure is a way station between life and death. Every Monday, a group of recently deceased people check-in: the social workers in the lodge ask them to go back over their life and choose one single memory to take into the afterlife. They are given just a couple of days to identify their happiest memory, after which the workers design, stage and film them. In this way, the souls will be able to re-experience this moment for eternity, forgetting the rest of their life. They will spend eternity within their happiest memory.\\nTwenty-two souls of different ages and backgrounds arrive and are received by the counsellors, who explain to them their situation. Lengthy interviews take place in the lodge, with each person having different perspectives of their lives. There is a gentle old woman whose fondest memory is cherry blossoms. There is an aviator whose happiest moments were spent flying through the clouds. There is also a teenager whose happiest memory is a ride at Disneyland. Told that 30 other children/teens have chosen Disneyland rides, she is gently coaxed into coming up with something more original from her childhood (the scent of fresh laundry and the feeling of her mother, whom she was cuddling against). A 78-year-old woman talks about a new dress her brother bought her for a childhood dance recital, a brother she loved and took care of \"until the very end.\" A prostitute remembers a client who was kind; a potential suicide victim recalls what made him pull back from the brink; an old man remembers the breeze on his face when he rode a trolley to school. An older man incessantly talks about sex and prostitutes, but ultimately chooses a memory in which his daughter hands him the bouquet at her wedding. A wild-haired 21-year-old wearing leather pants refuses point-blank to choose anything at all.\\nThe story pays most attention to the two younger counsellors, Takashi and Shiori. Takashi has been assigned to help Ichiro Watanabe, a 70-year-old man who glumly remembers his dull, conventional life in an arranged marriage as unfulfilling. To jog his memory, Takashi plays back excerpts from a file of year-by-year videotapes recording Watanabe\\'s life. Takashi learns from the films that Watanabe\\'s wife (from Watanabe\\'s arranged marriage) was also Takashi\\'s love of his life and fiancee, and that the two men are about the same age. Takashi died in his early twenties in the Philippines in World War II and has been working at the processing center since then. He, like the other clerks, was unwilling to choose a memory and must remain in limbo, working at the processing center, until they choose a memory. Takashi requests Watanabe to be assigned to another counsellor but his request is not granted.\\nNear the end of the week, Watanabe decides which memory to keep. Watanabe apologies to Takashi for causing Takashi trouble and picking a memory so late. Takashi asks him to not apologize and reveals to Watanabe that all the counsellors staying in the lodge are souls who refused or were unable to choose a memory.\\nThe social workers recreate the memories by filming on sets with basic stage props (cotton balls serve as clouds for the pilot; an audio recording of street noise is played while the old man stands in a trolley and social workers jostle the trolley to replicate movement). On Saturday, the twenty two hosted souls watch the films of their recreated memories in a screening room and, as soon as each person sees their own, they vanish.\\nTakashi, while putting away the videotapes from Watanabe\\'s room, finds a letter from Watanabe saying Watanabe realized that his wife was Takashi\\'s fiance, and his wife had visited Takashi\\'s grave every year, alone, during her and Watanabe\\'s marriage. Watanabe writes in his letter that he appreciates Takashi\\'s kindness in not mentioning that he was his wife\\'s dead fiance, and that it was only through his experience with Takashi and watching the videotapes that he was able to come to peace with his life and choose a memory with his wife.\\nTakashi talks to Shiori about his life, and Shiori finds his fiancée\\'s selected memory from the archive. In watching his fiance\\'s selected memory, Takashi realizes she chose a memory with him, before his death. In discovering that he had figured in his fiancé\\'s chosen moment to cherish, Takashi comes to the realization that \"I have learnt I was part of someone else\\'s happiness.\" He chooses that moment of realization as his sliver of life to be filmed and abandons the way station forever, spending eternity in this memory.\\nThe film ends with Shiori, now a full-fledged counsellor, practicing for an interview.\\n'},\n",

They release fireflies into the shelter for light. The next day, Setsuko is horrified to find that the insects have died. She buries them in a grave, asking why they and her mother had to die. As they run out of rice, Seita steals from farmers and loots homes during air raids, for which he is beaten and sent to the police by a farmer. The officer realizes Seita is stealing due to hunger and releases him. When Setsuko falls ill, a doctor explains that she is suffering from malnutrition. Desperate, Seita withdraws the last of the money in their mother's bank account. After doing so, he becomes distraught when he learns that Japan has surrendered, and that his father, an Imperial Japanese Navy captain, is most likely dead, as most of Japan's navy has been sunk. Seita returns to Setsuko with food, but finds her dying. She later dies as Seita finishes preparing the food. Seita cremates Setsuko's body and her stuffed doll in a straw casket. He carries her ashes in the candy tin along with his father's photograph.\\nThat September, Seita dies of starvation at a Sannomiya train station surrounded by other malnourished people, as shown in medias res. A janitor is tasked with removing the bodies before the arrival of the Americans. The janitor sorts through Seita's possessions and finds the candy tin, which he throws into a field. Setsuko's ashes spread out, and her spirit springs from the tin and is joined by Seita's spirit and a cloud of fireflies. They board a ghostly train and, throughout the journey, look back at the events leading to Seita's death. Their spirits later arrive at their destination, healthy and happy. Surrounded by fireflies, they rest on a hilltop bench overlooking present-day Kobe.\\n\"},\n",

       "  'Description': \"Princess Mononoke (Japanese: もののけ姫, Hepburn: Mononoke-hime) is a 1997 Japanese adult animated epic historical fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network and Dentsu. The film stars the voices of Yōji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka, Kaoru Kobayashi, Masahiko Nishimura, Tsunehiko Kamijo, Akihiro Miwa, Mitsuko Mori, and Hisaya Morishige.\\nPrincess Mononoke is set in the late Muromachi period of Japan (approximately 1336 to 1573 AD), but it includes fantasy elements. The story follows a young Emishi prince named Ashitaka, and his involvement in a struggle between the gods (kami) of a forest and the humans who consume its resources. The film deals with themes of Shintoism and environmentalism. The term mononoke (物の怪), or もののけ, is not a name, but a Japanese word for supernatural, shape-shifting beings that possess people and cause suffering, disease, or death.\\nThe film was released in Japan on July 12, 1997 by Toho, and in the United States on October 29, 1999. This was the first Studio Ghibli film in the United States to be rated PG-13 by the MPA. It was a critical and commercial blockbuster, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan of 1997, and also held Japan's box office record for domestic films until 2001's Spirited Away, another Miyazaki film. It was dubbed into English with a script by Neil Gaiman and initially distributed in North America by Miramax, where it sold well on DVD and video, despite a poor box office performance. The film greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan.[citation needed]\\n\\nPlot: In the Muromachi period, in Japan; an Emishi village is attacked by a hideous demon. The last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but it manages to grasp his arm and curse him before its death. The curse grants him superhuman strength, but it also causes a scar-like mark that will surround him, cause him pain, and eventually kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was a boar god (boar kami), corrupted by an iron ball lodged in his body. The village's wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands that the demon came from, and that he cannot return to his homeland.\\nHeading west, Ashitaka meets Jigo, an opportunistic monk who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest Spirit, a deer-like animal god by day and a giant Night Walker by night. Nearby, men on a cliffside herd oxen to their home of Iron Town, led by Lady Eboshi, and repel an attack by a wolf pack led by the wolf goddess Moro, whom Eboshi wounds with a gun shot. Riding one of the wolves is San, a human girl. Down below, Ashitaka encounters San and the wolves, who rebuff his greeting. He then manages to rescue two of the men fallen from the cliff and transports them back through the forest, where he briefly glimpses the Great Forest Spirit.\\nAshitaka and the survivors arrive at Iron Town, where he is greeted with fascination. Iron Town is a refuge for outcasts and lepers employed to process iron and create firearms, such as hand cannons and matchlock muskets. Ashitaka learns that the town was built by clear cutting forests to mine the iron, leading to conflicts with Asano, a local daimyō, and a giant boar god named Nago. Eboshi admits that she shot Nago, incidentally turning him into the demon that attacked Ashitaka's village. She also reveals that San, dubbed Princess Mononoke, was raised by the wolves and hates humankind.\\nSan infiltrates Iron Town to kill Eboshi. Ashitaka intervenes and quickly subdues Eboshi and San while they are locked in combat. Amidst the hysteria he is shot by a villager, but the curse gives him strength to carry San out of the village. San awakens and prepares to kill the weakened Ashitaka, but hesitates when he tells her that she is beautiful. She decides to trust him after the Forest Spirit heals his bullet wound that night. The next day, a boar clan led by the blind god Okkoto plans to attack Iron Town to save the forest. Eboshi sets out to kill the Forest Spirit with Jigo; Eboshi intends to give the god's head to the Emperor (who believes it will grant him immortality) in return for protection from Lord Asano, while Jigo desires the large reward being offered.\\nAshitaka recovers and finds Iron Town besieged by Asano's samurai. The boar clan has been annihilated in battle, and Okkoto is badly wounded. Jigo's men trick Okkoto into leading them to the Forest Spirit. San tries to stop Okkoto but is swept up as his pain corrupts him into a demon. As everyone clashes at the pool of the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka saves San while the Forest Spirit euthanizes Moro and Okkoto. As it begins to transform into the Night Walker, Eboshi decapitates it. Jigo steals the head, while the Forest Spirit's body bleeds ooze that spreads over the land and kills anything it touches. The forest and kodama (木霊, tree spirits)[2] begin to die; Moro's head briefly comes alive and bites off Eboshi's right arm, but she survives. Enraged, San attempts to kill Eboshi again, but is stopped by Ashitaka, who consoles her and encourages her not to give up.\\nAfter Iron Town is evacuated, Ashitaka and San pursue Jigo and retrieve the head, returning it to the Forest Spirit. The Spirit dies but its form washes over the land, healing it and lifting Ashitaka's curse. Ashitaka stays to help rebuild Iron Town, but promises San he will visit her in the forest. Grateful to Ashitaka and San, Eboshi vows to build a better town. The forest begins to regrow as a single kodama emerges from the brush.\\n\"},\n",

Written by Krzysztof Kieślowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz, the film is about a young post office worker deeply in love with a promiscuous older woman who lives in an adjacent apartment building.[1]\\nA Short Film About Love is an expanded film version of Dekalog: Six, part of Kieślowski\\'s 1988 Polish language ten-part television series, Dekalog. The film is set in Warsaw. The film was selected as the Polish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 61st Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.[2]\\n\\nPlot: Nineteen-year-old Tomek (Olaf Lubaszenko) is living in an apartment complex in Warsaw with his godmother (Stefania Iwinska) - staying in her son\\'s room while he\\'s away. Raised in an orphanage, the shy Tomek has few friends and works as a postal clerk. Tomek has been spying on a beautiful older woman, Magda (Grażyna Szapolowska), who lives in an adjacent apartment complex. Using a telescope, he watches her every night performing mundane tasks, working on her artwork, and entertaining men. To get closer to her, he slips fake postal notices in her mailbox for a nonexistent money order at his post office. He also calls her anonymously to hear her voice. Tomek\\'s obsession is focused more on her everyday activities rather than her sex life; when he sees her becoming sexual with men, he trains the telescope away and does not watch.\\nTomek learns there is a problem with the milk deliveries for Magda\\'s apartment complex, so he takes the delivery job to be closer to her. One night he sees her return home after breaking up with her latest boyfriend, spilling a bottle of milk, and then weeping over another failed relationship. Later, Tomek asks his godmother, \"Why do people cry?\" After receiving another fake postal notice, Magda has a confrontation with the postmistress who accuses her of extortion. When Magda walks away upset, Tomek follows her and admits that he has been leaving the fake postal notices, that he saw her crying, and that he\\'s been watching her. That night, Magda arranges her bed so that Tomek can see her with another boyfriend. When they\\'re in bed, she tells him that they\\'re being watched by someone across the way. The boyfriend rushes down to the street, calls out to Tomek who comes downstairs, and then punches him in the face for peeping.\\nThe next day, while delivering milk to Magda, Tomek admits that he loves her and that he expects nothing in return. Overwhelmed by his feelings, Tomek rushes up to the roof of the building, and then returns to Magda\\'s apartment and asks her for a date—and she accepts. An elated Tomek races through the courtyard with his milk cart. During their date at a café, Magda learns that Tomek has been watching her for a year and that he stole letters mailed to her by an old boyfriend. At first, she\\'s upset, but then she dismisses it saying, \"What does it matter.\" In response to his earlier declaration of love, she tells him that love doesn\\'t exist—only sex. She shows him how to caress her hands the way lovers do.\\nLater that night at her apartment, after she showers and changes into a short bathrobe, he gives her a small gift, but she says she\\'s not a good person and doesn\\'t deserve gifts. Crouching in front of him, she guides his hands onto her thighs and he has an orgasm. Magda says, \"Love ... that\\'s all it is.\" After Tomek rushes out of her apartment embarrassed and upset, Magda feels guilty and tries to communicate to him at her window—gesturing for him to call her and holding up a sign that reads, \"Come back. Sorry.\" But there is no response. Back in his apartment, Tomek cuts his wrists with a razor blade. Later, Magda comes to Tomek\\'s apartment to return the coat he left behind and learns from his godmother that he tried to kill himself and was taken to hospital. Magda tells her, \"I think I hurt him.\" Tomek\\'s godmother shows her Tomek\\'s room and his telescope and tells her, \"He\\'s fallen in love with you.\" When asked if he\\'s \"fallen for the wrong woman,\" Magda responds, \"Yes.\"\\nIn the coming days, Magda is unable to find Tomek—she is clearly worried and concerned about his wellbeing. One night, she receives a phone call, and thinking it is Tomek, she acknowledges that he was right about love (the call is actually from someone with phone trouble). After days of waiting and watching Tomek\\'s window with her small binoculars, she finally sees he\\'s returned. Magda goes to Tomek\\'s apartment and his godmother shows her to his room where she sees Tomek sleeping, his wrists still bandaged. The godmother prevents her from getting too close to him—even preventing her from touching his bandaged wrist.[Note 1] Noticing the telescope, Magda looks through it toward her own apartment and imagines what Tomek must have seen that night, watching her come home, spilling the milk, and weeping over another failed relationship. Then she closes her eyes and imagines Tomek in her apartment with her, reaching out to comfort her—and she smiles.\\n'},\n",

It is a sequel to Kurosawa\\'s 1961 Yojimbo.[2]\\nOriginally an adaptation of the Shūgorō Yamamoto novel Hibi Heian, the script was altered following the success of the previous year\\'s Yojimbo to incorporate the lead character of that film.\\n\\nPlot: Nine young samurai believe that the lord chamberlain, Mutsuta, is corrupt after he tore up their petition against fraud at court. One of them tells the superintendent Kikui of this and he agrees to intervene. As the nine meet secretly to discuss this at a shrine, a rōnin overhears and cautions them against trusting the superintendent. While at first they do not believe him, he saves them from an ambush. But as their rescuer is about to leave, he realises that Mutsuta and his family must now be in danger and decides to stay and help.\\nBy the time the samurai get to Mutsuta\\'s house, the chamberlain has been abducted and his wife and daughter are held prisoner there. Following the rōnin\\'s suggestion, a servant from the house gets the guards drunk, allowing the samurai to free the women. Then the group hide in a house next door to the superintendent\\'s compound. When Mutsuta\\'s wife asks the rōnin his name, he looks out of the window at the surrounding camellia trees and says it is Tsubaki Sanjūrō (椿三十郎), literally \"thirty-year-old camellia\". The lady then criticises \"Sanjuro\" for killing too frequently and insists that \"the best sword is kept in its sheath.\"\\nSanjuro decides to get closer to the corrupt officials and joins their henchman Hanbei, who had previously offered him a job after the ambush at the shrine. Although the samurai distrustfully decide to keep watch on him, Sanjuro realises he is being followed as he walks along with Hanbei, and their shadows are easily captured and bound. Made to believe that a much larger group may be involved, Hanbei leaves to request reinforcements. Sanjuro then frees the four captured samurai, although having to kill all their guards. He tells the four to leave him tied up, then explains to Hanbei on his return that he did not wish to die in a cause in which he had no stake.\\nThe chamberlain\\'s whereabouts are not discovered until next day, when Mutsuta\\'s wife and daughter find a piece of the torn petition in the small stream that flows from the superintendent\\'s compound past their hideout. Since an attack on the officials is impossible with the compound full of armed men, Sanjuro hatches a plan to get the army away by reporting to Hanbei that he saw the rebels at a temple where he was sleeping. Meanwhile he has told his group of samurai that he will send the signal to attack by floating large numbers of camellias down the stream.\\nThe first part of the plan works, with the superintendent\\'s forces rushing off to the temple; however, Hanbei becomes suspicious after catching Sanjuro trying to drop the camellias into the stream and ties him up. Just as Hanbei is preparing to kill him, the remaining corrupt officials realise that Sanjuro has tricked them—his description of the temple was incorrect. They convince Hanbei not to waste any further time and instead catch up with the superintendent\\'s forces and have them return as soon as possible. However, Sanjuro tricks the officials into giving the signal for the samurai to come to the rescue. Hanbei returns to find he has been made a fool of once again.\\nMutsuta is restored to his position and the superintendent commits hara-kiri, much to the chamberlain\\'s regret, as he wished to avoid a public scandal. As his family and the loyal samurai are celebrating, they discover that Sanjuro has slipped away. The samurai race off and find Sanjuro and Hanbei about to duel.\\nSanjuro is reluctant to fight and tries to dissuade Hanbei, but Hanbei is furious at his loss of dignity and declares he can only find ease by killing Sanjuro. Hanbei draws his sword, but the faster Sanjuro kills him. When the young samurai cheer his victory, Sanjuro becomes angry and says he will kill them if they follow him. His admirers can only kneel and bow as he walks away.\\n'},\n",

Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a Jewish Italian bookshop owner, who employs his imagination to shield his son from the horrors of internment in a Nazi concentration camp. The film was partially inspired by the book In the End, I Beat Hitler by Rubino Romeo Salmonì and by Benigni\\'s father, who spent two years in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp during World War II.\\nThe film was an overwhelming critical and commercial success. It received widespread acclaim, with critics praising its story, performances, direction and the union of drama and comedy, despite some criticisms of using the subject matter for comedic purposes. The movie grossed over $230\\xa0million worldwide, including $57.6 million in the United States, is the second highest-grossing foreign language film in the U.S. (after Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon)[4] and one of the highest-grossing non-English language movies of all time.[5] The National Board of Review included it in the top five best foreign films of 1998.[6]\\nThe movie won the Grand Prix at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, nine David di Donatello Awards (including Best Film), five Nastro d\\'Argento Awards in Italy, two European Film Awards, and three Academy Awards, including Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actor for Benigni, the first for a male non-English performance.[7]\\n\\nPlot: In 1939, in Fascist Italy, Guido Orefice is a young Italian Jewish man who arrives to work in the city of Arezzo, in Tuscany, where his uncle Eliseo works in the restaurant of a hotel. Guido is comical and sharp and falls in love with a Gentile girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to Rodolfo, a rich but arrogant local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many \"coincidental\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. \\nFinally, Dora sees Guido\\'s affection and promise and gives in, against her better judgment. He steals the lady from her engagement party, on a horse, humiliating her fiancé and mother. They are later married, have a son Giosuè, and run a bookstore.\\nDuring World War II, in 1944 when Northern Italy is occupied by Nazi Germany, Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosuè are seized on Giosuè\\'s birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train bound for a concentration camp. After confronting a guard about her husband and son and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. \\nHowever, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido do not see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp\\'s loudspeaker to send messages—symbolic or literal—to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is murdered in a gas chamber shortly after their arrival. Giosuè narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers and were told they were showers.\\nIn the camp, Guido hides the true situation from his son. Guido tells Giosuè that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Each of the tasks will earn them points and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Giosuè is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido convinces him each time to continue. \\nAt one point Guido takes advantage of the appearance of visiting German officers and their families to show Giosuè that other children are hiding as part of the game, and he also takes advantage of a German nanny thinking Giosuè is one of her charges in order to feed him as Guido serves the German officers. Guido and Giosuè are almost found out to be prisoners by another server until Guido is found teaching all of the German children how to say \"Thank you\" in Italian, effectively providing a ruse.\\nGuido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the Allied forces approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final task in the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but he is caught by a German soldier. An officer orders Guido to be executed and Guido is led off by the soldier. While he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosuè one last time and winks, still in character and playing the game. Guido is then shot and left for dead in an alleyway. \\nThe next morning, Giosuè emerges from the sweat-box, just as a U.S. Army unit led by a Sherman tank arrives and the camp is liberated. Giosuè is overjoyed about winning the game (unaware that his father is dead), thinking that he won the tank, and an American soldier allows Giosuè to ride on the tank. \\nWhile traveling to safety, Giosuè soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with his mother. While the young Giosuè excitedly tells his mother about how he had won a tank, just as his father had promised, the adult Giosuè, in an overheard monologue, reminisces on the sacrifices his father made for him and his story.\\n'},\n",

Amy\\'s fame as the inspiration for her parents\\' Amazing Amy children\\'s books ensures widespread press coverage. The media find Nick\\'s apathy towards the disappearance suspicious.\\nFlashbacks in the form of diary entries show a complex reality and a deterioriating marriage. Amazing Amy was an idealized completion of the real Amy\\'s failures. Both lost their jobs in the recession and moved from New York to Nick\\'s hometown of North Carthage, Missouri, to support his dying mother. Nick grew distant from Amy and began an affair with Andie, one of his students, while Amy became resentful towards Nick for uprooting her.\\nDetective Rhonda Boney and the forensic team find poorly concealed evidence of struggle and profuse blood loss in the house. Boney learns of financial issues, spousal disputes, and Amy\\'s recent attempt to buy a gun. Medical reports indicate Amy was pregnant, which Nick denies knowledge of.\\nOn every wedding anniversary, Amy had set up elaborate treasure hunts for Nick. This year\\'s clues appear in places where Nick had sex with Andie, thus revealing Amy\\'s knowledge of his affair. Nick discovers thousands of dollars of items purchased with his credit card hidden in his twin sister Margo\\'s woodshed. Amy\\'s clues lead authorities to a half-burnt diary documenting her growing dread of Nick and ending with a genuine fear that he will kill her.\\nThe audience then learns that Amy is alive and hiding in a campground in the Ozarks. After discovering Nick\\'s affair, Amy conceived an elaborate plan to frame him for her murder. She had him ramp up her life insurance and secretly used his credit card to buy the woodshed items. She befriended a pregnant neighbor, told her stories about Nick\\'s temper, and stole her urine to fake a pregnancy thus eliciting media sympathy after her disappearance. She wrote a diary with increasingly fabricated entries, and placed incriminating evidence in the treasure hunt spots for the police to find. On the morning of her disappearance, Amy drained and splattered her own blood across the kitchen, and cleaned it haphazardly. Her original plan was to drown herself after Nick\\'s arrest, in order to ensure his death sentence.\\nNick deduces Amy\\'s scheme, convinces Margo of his innocence and hires lawyer Tanner Bolt, known for representing uxoricide suspects. Nick meets two of Amy\\'s ex-boyfriends: Tommy O\\'Hara claims he was framed for rape by her after he ended their relationship; wealthy Desi Collings, against whom Amy had filed a restraining order for stalking, turns Nick away.\\nWhen Amy\\'s campground neighbors rob her, she calls Desi for help, convincing him that she fled Nick\\'s abuse. Desi agrees to hide her in his lakehouse. Bolt convinces Nick to reveal his affair on a popular talk show, thus seizing the narrative initiative from the media. Andie reveals the affair at a press conference shortly before the show, but Nick insists on conducting the interview. He affirms his innocence and feigns regret for his shortcomings as a spouse, knowing that Amy will be watching.\\nThe interview is a success, garnering widespread sympathy for Nick. However, Boney has already gathered enough murder evidence and arrests Nick and Margo. Bolt bails them out, and they brace for the impending trial. After watching Nick\\'s interview, Amy rekindles her attraction to him and spends weeks crafting her escape story. Using lakehouse surveillance cameras and self-inflicted wrist and vaginal injuries, she makes it appear that Desi kidnapped and raped her. She then seduces Desi, slits his throat during sex and returns home covered in his blood, thus clearing Nick of suspicion.\\nMedical examiners lend credence to Amy\\'s story. During questioning, Boney probes her inconsistencies but Amy spins the focus onto Boney by calling her incompetent. The FBI believes Amy and closes the case, but Boney remains convinced of Amy\\'s guilt. Upon returning home, Amy tells Nick the truth, admitting to Desi\\'s murder. She states that the Nick pleading for her return on TV is the one she wants, and the one who inspired her forgiveness. Nick shares this with Boney, Bolt, and Margo. Despite unanimously agreeing that Amy is guilty, everyone acknowledges a lack of evidence. Bolt wishes Nick well and returns to New York.  \\nA televised interview takes place in their home seven weeks later. Anticipating Nick\\'s intention to leave her and publicly expose her story, Amy reveals her pregnancy minutes before the interview, having inseminated herself with Nick\\'s sperm from a fertility clinic.

The widescreen cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli and the acclaimed film score was by Ennio Morricone.\\nAfter directing The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Leone decided to retire from Westerns and aimed to produce his film based on the novel The Hoods, which eventually became Once Upon a Time in America. However, Leone accepted an offer from Paramount Pictures providing Henry Fonda and a budget to produce another Western. He recruited Bertolucci and Argento to devise the plot of the film in 1966, researching other Western films in the process. After Clint Eastwood turned down an offer to play the movie\\'s protagonist, Bronson was offered the role. During production, Leone recruited Donati to rewrite the script due to concerns over time limitations.\\nThe original version by the director was 166 minutes  when it was first released on 21 December 1968. This version was shown in European cinemas, and was a box-office success. For the US release on 28 May 1969, Once Upon a Time in the West was edited down to 145 minutes  by Paramount and was a financial flop. \\nThe film is the first installment in Leone\\'s Once Upon a Time trilogy, followed by Duck, You Sucker! and Once Upon a Time in America, though the films do not share any characters in common.[7]\\nIn 2009, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[8][9] The film is regarded as one of the greatest Westerns of all time and one of the greatest films of all time.[10][11][12][13]\\n\\nPlot: A train arrives at the Old West town of \"Flagstone\". A man with a harmonica on a thong about his neck alights and faces three gunfighters who are waiting for him, killing all three. Their leader, an outlaw called Frank, is working as a hired gunman for the railroad tycoon, Morton, who is trying to acquire land owned by Brett McBain\\'s family. \\nThe dusters worn by the three outlaws lead Harmonica to believe they are a rival outlaw, Cheyenne\\'s men. Meanwhile, Frank and his henchmen kill McBain and his three children at their \"Sweetwater\" ranch and leave behind evidence to frame Cheyenne for the murders.\\nA woman named Jill arrives in Flagstone, supposedly to marry McBain at Sweetwater. In fact, she is a former New Orleans prostitute who married McBain a month earlier, so she is the sole heir to Sweetwater. As it will emerge, McBain knew the railroad would pass through Sweetwater one day and planned to build a watering station there, subject to a reverter that he would forfeit Sweetwater if the station was not built by the time the railroad reached it. Morton told Frank to only intimidate McBain, and the murder has put them at odds. Morton wants to make a deal with Jill, but Frank wants the land for himself.\\nCheyenne denies that it was his men who tried to ambush Harmonica and murder the McBains. Harmonica saves Jill from two of Frank\\'s men and spies out the railway carriage to which Morton is confined on crutches, owing to his spinal tuberculosis. Harmonica discovers the connection between Frank and Morton but is seen and captured. When Frank asks for Harmonica\\'s name, he replies with names of men that Frank has killed in the past. Frank is called away and Cheyenne rescues Harmonica. The two collaborate to help Jill save Sweetwater, using stockpiled materials to start building a station.\\nAfter a threatening sexual encounter with Frank, Jill is forced to auction the land while Frank\\'s henchmen intimidate the bidders in order to keep the purchase price low. Suddenly, Harmonica appears with Cheyenne in tow and bids $5,000, which is the price on Cheyenne\\'s head as a wanted fugitive, and gets the property himself. Meanwhile, Morton has bribed Frank\\'s own men to kill him, but Harmonica intervenes to save Frank from being ambushed in the street. When Jill condemns Harmonica for saving Frank\\'s life, he replies \"I didn\\'t let them (Frank\\'s men) kill him and that\\'s not the same thing\". \\nCheyenne soon escapes custody and he and his gang engage Frank\\'s remaining men in a gunfight on Morton\\'s train. Except for Cheyenne, who heads to Sweetwater, everyone is killed, including Morton. When Frank sees the aftermath of the fight, he rides to Sweetwater too, where he finds Harmonica waiting. Cheyenne has arrived earlier, but he remains in the ranch house with Jill. Outside, Harmonica and Frank engage in a showdown; through a flashback, it is revealed that Frank had once hanged Harmonica\\'s older brother, forcing the younger brother to support him on his shoulders. Just before the panting boy collapsed under the weight, Frank had forced a harmonica into his mouth, telling him to \"keep your lovin\\' brother happy\". \\nHarmonica beats Frank to the draw. As he lies dying, Frank again asks Harmonica\\'s identity and Harmonica places the instrument in Frank\\'s mouth. Frank remembers, nods his head, and dies.   \\nJill hopes he will stay with her but, as Cheyenne has already told her, that won\\'t happen. Jill asks Harmonica to come back and he says: \"Some day\". Harmonica and Cheyenne leave Sweetwater together, but Cheyenne collapses and dies from a gut wound he received in the gunfight with Morton. As Harmonica departs carrying Cheyenne\\'s body on a horse, Jill serves water to the railroad workers.\\n'},\n",

Woody is picked up by his son David, who learns that Woody wants to go to Lincoln, Nebraska, to collect a million dollar sweepstakes prize he believes he has won. When David sees the sweepstakes letter, he knows immediately that it is a mail scam designed to get gullible people to purchase magazine subscriptions. David brings his father home, where his mother Kate becomes increasingly annoyed by Woody\\'s insistence on collecting the money.\\nAfter Woody is picked up again trying to get to Nebraska, David and his brother Ross discuss putting Woody in a retirement home. Ross is especially frustrated because their Dad didn\\'t put any effort into parenting them and used to drink a lot. He doesn\\'t feel they \\'owe\\' their father anything.\\nDavid is visited by his ex-girlfriend, Noelle, who returns his belongings and refuses to move back in with him. Their conversation is cut short by a call from Kate reporting that Woody has taken off once again. David retrieves Woody and decides to drive him all the way to Lincoln, much to Kate\\'s dismay and anger.\\nWhile in Rapid City, South Dakota, Woody goes on a bender and hits his head while stumbling back to their motel room.

       "  'Description': 'Battle Royale (バトル・ロワイアル, Batoru Rowaiaru) is a 2000 Japanese action-thriller film[4][5] directed by Kinji Fukasaku, with a screenplay written by Kenta Fukasaku, based on the controversial 1999 novel by Koushun Takami. Starring Tatsuya Fujiwara, Aki Maeda, Tarō Yamamoto, and Takeshi Kitano, the film follows a group of junior-high-school students forced to fight to the death by the Japanese totalitarian government. The film drew controversy and was banned or excluded from distribution in several countries;[6][7] Toei Company refused to sell the film to any United States distributor for over a decade due to concerns about potential controversy and lawsuits, until Anchor Bay Entertainment eventually acquired the film in 2010 for a direct-to-video release.[8]\\nThe film was first screened in Tokyo on more than 200 screens on December 16, 2000, with an R15+ rating, which is rarely used in Japan.[9][10][11] It was the highest-grossing Japanese-language film for six weeks after its initial release, and it was later released in 22 countries worldwide,[6][12] grossing over $30 million in ten countries. The film earned critical acclaim and, especially with its DVD releases, drew a large global cult following. It is often regarded as one of Fukasaku\\'s best films, and one of the best films of the 2000s. In 2009, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised Battle Royale as his favourite film of the past two decades.[13][14]\\nBattle Royale was the last film to be directed by Fukasaku. He also started working on the sequel titled Battle Royale II: Requiem, but died of prostate cancer on January 12, 2003, after shooting only one scene with Kitano. His son Kenta Fukasaku, who wrote the screenplay for both films, completed the film in 2003. \\nThe film is notable for featuring many young unknown actors who become stars later on. The film spawned the battle royale genre, including battle royale games, anime, comic books, films, manga and television shows.\\n\\nPlot: In the near-future, following a major recession and high unemployment rate, the Japanese government has passed the \"BR Act\" to curb the nation\\'s juvenile delinquency, which takes a random class of delinquent students and sends them to the Battle Royale games where only one survivor gets to make it out alive, thus becoming a good citizen of Japan. Middle school student Shuya Nanahara copes with life after his father committed suicide. One day in the middle of the school year, their teacher, Kitano, resigns after being wounded with a knife by Yoshitoki Kuninobu, Shuya\\'s best friend. One of Shuya\\'s classmates, Noriko Nakagawa, picks up the knife and secretly keeps it in her possession.\\nOne year later, Shuya\\'s class believes they are taking a field trip, but they are gassed and taken to a remote island. Kitano reappears surrounded by JSDF soldiers, explaining that the class was chosen to participate in the annual Battle Royale as a result of the Act: they have three days to fight to the death until a victor emerges; explosive collars will kill uncooperative students or those within designated \"danger zones\". Kitano tells the class that they were chosen due to their disobedience. Each student is provided rations, a map, supplies, and a random weapon or item. To prove that this is no game, Kitano kills two of the students for disobedience, one of them being Kuninobu. The students disperse one by one as they get their equipment from the JSDF soldiers.\\nInitially, most students do not engage in combat, but eventually one by one they start to accept their current situation. As the hours goes on, some of the students reveal their true feelings for each other after realizing that death is near, while some try to work together to get rid of the explosive necklaces or to survive as long as possible by making a pact. The first six hours see 12 deaths, with four by suicide. The psychotic but mysterious female classmate who has no friends, Mitsuko Souma, and psychopathic high school student Kazuo Kiriyama become the most dangerous players to others in the game. Transfer student Shogo Kawada lets Shuya go after killing one student, while Shuya accidentally kills another student. Basketball player Shinji Mimura plots to hack into the computer system to disrupt the program, and in the process recruits some of his classmates.\\nAmid shifting loyalties and violent confrontations, Shuya promises to keep Noriko safe, feeling it a duty to his fallen friend, as Kuninobu secretly loved her. They are eventually rescued from Mitsuko Souma by Kawada, who takes them to a safe location after realizing they are of no threat. Kawada reveals to the pair that he won a previous Battle Royale at the cost of his girlfriend, who sacrificed herself to save him during the end of the last Battle Royale as they were the final two remaining. He decided to volunteer for the current Battle Royale game to avenge her death by winning the game and killing whoever was in charge at the end. Kiriyama eventually attacks and Shuya is wounded by his Uzi. He is saved by Hiroki Sugimura, who had his best friend die in his arms. \\nShuya awakens in the island\\'s lighthouse, bandaged by Yukie Utsumi, who has a crush on him. Five other girls are also hiding in the building, all having made a pact to not participate in the Battle Royale game. Yuko Sakaki, who is fearful of Shuya after witnessing him accidentally kill Tatsumichi Oki earlier, attempts to poison him out of fear of him killing them. However, one of the girls, Yuka, accidentally eats the food, leading to a confrontation between the girls which results in a shootout. Yuko is the only survivor; horrified and full of guilt, she commits suicide by jumping to her death. Shuya, Noriko, and Kawada set out to find Mimura.\\nMeanwhile, Kiriyama meets Mitsuko and kills her after a short battle, making Noriko the last surviving girl. Mimura, with two others, successfully infiltrates the JSDF\\'s computer system and glitches the entire system while the JSDF soldiers begin to panic, causing Kitano to manually reset the whole system. Kiriyama  arrives and kills them, but not before Mimura uses his homemade bomb to blow up the base to hide all evidence and to kill Kiriyama. When the trio arrives at the burning base, Kawada engages in a gun battle with Kiriyama, who survived the explosion but had both his eyes burned out by the explosion. During the shootout, Kawada is injured by Kiriyama\\'s Uzi, while Kawada manages to hit the explosive collar on Kiriyama\\'s neck, causing his entire head to explode.\\nOn the final day, the trio awakens on the shore of the island. Kawada, aware of the collars\\' internal microphones, tells Shuya and Noriko that only one survivor will make it out alive, and seemingly kills Shuya and Noriko by shooting them. Disappointed, Kitano ends the game and shuts off the entire system after hearing the two\\'s apparent deaths through the speaker, telling the JSDF soldiers to end the operation and go home. Kitano waits alone for the winner to return. As Kawada arrives alone, he brings him into the base to be declared the victor but quickly realizes that Kawada hacked the system months beforehand, meaning Mimura and his team were not the real hackers. Kawada had also disabled Shuya and Noriko\\'s tracking devices, thus tricking Kitano into believing the two were dead. Shuya and Noriko arrive and the trio confronts Kitano in the control room. He then unveils a homemade painting of the massacred class with his hope for the outcome of the Battle Royale game, depicting Noriko as the sole survivor. He also reveals his feelings towards her as she was one of the few students who treated him nice as their teacher, which causes Noriko to go into a panic. He reveals that he was unable to bear the hatred between him and his students, having been rejected by his own daughter, and confesses that he always thought of Noriko as a daughter. He asks her to kill him, but Shuya shoots him after he takes out a gun and threatens them, eventually revealed to only be a water gun. Kitano seemingly dies from his wounds, but gets up to answer his cellphone which starts to ring. Kitano\\'s daughter calls him; after an argument in which Kitano finally tells his daughter what he really thinks of her, he dies of his wounds.\\nThe trio leaves the island on a boat, but Kawada dies from his injuries, happy that he found friendship. Some time later, Noriko sneaks out of her house to meet Shuya, giving Shuya the Seto Dragon Claw butterfly knife that Kuninobu used to injure Kitano at the beginning. Shuya and Noriko are declared fugitives by the Japanese government, last seen on the run toward Shibuya Station in the early Tokyo morning.\\nIn the epilogue, it is revealed that Mitsuko Souma had a rough upbringing, almost getting assaulted by a man while as a young girl, killing the man by pushing him down some stairs. In high school she became reclusive and cannot fit into any groups of friends, feeling abandoned and alone. For the rest of the classmates who had died, they are shown in a school basketball game celebrating a win and enjoying life during a happier time. For Shuya, in his epilogue he dreams of Kuninobu, who tells him to move on with his life and that everything will be okay. For Noriko, she thinks back to the time she met Kitano for ice cream bars after he had left the school after being attacked. While the two walk along the river she optimistically reveals to him that she has the knife that wounded him in her possession. Kitano pauses then responds to her with \"In this moment, what should an adult say to a kid?”\\n'},\n",

It also provided the premise for the 2014 American television show, Taxi Brooklyn.\\n\\nPlot: Daniel Morales (Samy Naceri) is a highly talented driver living in Marseille, France, who has little regard for traffic laws and the police, and is in a loving relationship with his girlfriend Lilly (Marion Cotillard). He leaves his job as a delivery man at local pizza parlor \"Pizza Joe\" to become a taxi driver, driving his white custom 1997 Peugeot 406, which is equipped with various racing modifications that are mechanically concealed.[2]\\nYoung, bumbling police inspector Émilien Coutant-Kerbalec (Frédéric Diefenthal) lives with his widowed mother, and has just failed his 8th driver\\'s test. No one takes him seriously at work, including police sergeant Petra (Emma Sjöberg), towards whom he harbors an unrequited crush. Commissioner Gibert (Bernard Farcy) soon briefs the officers on a new case: a German gang that has successfully committed a series of high profile robberies throughout Europe, and has now arrived in Marseille. The gang is known for their efficiency, skilled driving, and their use of red Mercedes-Benz 500E cars as escape vehicles. Anticipating the gang\\'s next move, Gibert places police officers around the targeted bank. After the robbers enter the bank, Émilien accidentally causes a multi-vehicle collision and a gun fight with the French Minister\\'s escort convoy, allowing the Germans to escape.\\nThe next day, Émilien decides to take a taxi to work and rides with Daniel.

The next morning, Émilien tries to interrogate Kruger, who opens fire at the duo and escapes.\\nThe police locate the gang\\'s next target and manage to shoot a tracking device onto one of the cars. However, the gang stops at a secluded garage and repaints the cars silver, inadvertently sabotaging the tracking device and allowing them to escape again. Émilien then learns that he had left the stove on at his flat and burned it down, forcing him and his mother to stay at Daniel\\'s place. Eager to get rid of Émilien, Daniel correctly deduces the gang\\'s repaint strategy, and through a friend he tracks the robbers to a racetrack. Daniel provokes the gang into a race and wins, later inspring Émilien to approach Petra romantically. The duo then become friends, and devise a plan to finally catch the gang red-handed.\\nThe next day, having duplicated the control keys to twenty traffic lights throughout the city, Émilien provides Daniel with a closed radio line. Daniel recruits his old co-workers from Pizza Joe, to whom Émilien distributes the keys and walkie-talkies. After the gang drives away from another robbery, Daniel follows them and successfully taunts the Germans into another race. As the delivery men use the traffic lights to clear a path for the cars, the cars drive onto the freeway. Daniel then speeds towards a bridge that is under construction, and slams on the brake; the gang\\'s cars jump over the gap and lands on the other side, only to discover that they are trapped on an incomplete bridge section.\\nAfter the gang is arrested, Daniel and Émilien are given medals by the police commissioner, and Émilien begins dating Petra.

Dag\\'s girlfriend, Mia Bergman, is writing her doctoral thesis on sex trafficking. Dag is nearly finished with the story and is confronting those who will be exposed by the article. Dag and his girlfriend are about to leave on a holiday and ask Mikael Blomkvist to come to his apartment and collect some photographs.

While he is unaware of Salander\\'s whereabouts, Paolo does know Miriam, who also trained with them, and promises to pay her a visit. Near her apartment, Paolo witnesses Miriam being kidnapped by strongman Ronald Niedermann. Paolo follows his car to a deserted barn, where he hears him beat Miriam for information about Salander. Paolo comes in to rescue her but Niedermann beats him too. He then sets the barn aflame, but the two manage to escape.\\nNews breaks of the attack, and Paolo gives his account to the police. After Blomkvist leaves information that he has discovered about the case on his computer for Salander to hack into and read, she leaves a message to him saying, \"Thank you for being my friend.\" He realizes that she intends to set out alone to find the man who framed her and that she may not survive. A disguised Salander visits Miriam in hospital to apologize for getting her involved. Without giving anything away, Salander confirms the police sketch of Niedermann with Miriam and then disappears. Knowing now that he is Salander\\'s friend, Miriam calls Blomkvist to the hospital to give him keys that Lisbeth dropped during her visit. Noticing that one of them is for a post office box, Blomkvist is able to access and read Salander\\'s mail and locate her apartment. Meanwhile, Salander continues her efforts to find Niedermann by patiently staking out his post office box.

She awakens to see her father, Alexander \"Zala\" Zalachenko, an old man who walks with a stick and is heavily scarred by the burns that she inflicted as a child. He dismisses her mother as a whore and belittles her rape at the hands of Bjurman. He reveals that Niedermann is her half-brother and that Niedermann killed Bjurman to prevent him from revealing any of Zalachenko\\'s secrets.\\nThey lead Lisbeth to a shallow grave in the woods. She tells him that the police will find him soon and all that he has said has been published online through her hidden cellphone. Seeing through her bluff, he shoots Lisbeth several times as she attempts to escape and buries her alive. Salander digs her way out using her cigarette case. Hidden in the woodshed, she surprises Zalachenko and sticks an axe into his leg. She then keeps Niedermann at bay with Zalachenko\\'s gun as Blomkvist comes coasting up the driveway.

He experiments with various methods, but none bear positive results. He then meets \"Golden Leg\" Fung; a legendary Hong Kong soccer star in his day, who is now walking with a limp, following the betrayal of a former teammate, Hung, now a rich businessman.

The film stars Karra Elejalde as Héctor, a man who unwittingly becomes part of a causal loop and must stop his other selves from continuing to exist.\\n\\nPlot: In the Spanish countryside, a middle-aged man named Héctor and his wife Clara live in a home that they are renovating. Héctor scans the forest behind their house with binoculars and sees a young woman take off her T-shirt, exposing her breasts. When his wife goes shopping, he investigates and finds the woman on the ground, naked and unconscious. He is stabbed in the arm by a mysterious man with bloody bandages on his face. Fleeing and breaking into a mysterious nearby building, Héctor contacts a scientist by walkie-talkie, who warns him of the bandaged man and guides him to his location, promising safety. The scientist convinces Héctor to hide from the bandaged man, who is just outside, in a large mechanical device. However, when he leaves the machine, Héctor discovers that he has traveled approximately an hour back in time.\\nThe scientist explains that the machine is an experimental time travel device, and refers to Héctor as \"Héctor 2\".

Despite the scientist\\'s warning, Héctor 2 drives off in a car, passing a cyclist, only to be run off the road by a van, cutting his head, which he wraps using the bandage from his arm wound.

The film serves as a standalone sequel to Oshii\\'s 1995 film Ghost in the Shell and is loosely based on the manga by Masamune Shirow.\\nThe film was co-produced by Production I.G and Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Toho and D-Rights, and distributed by Toho. It was released in Japan on March 6, 2004, and was later released in the US on September 17, 2004 by Go Fish Pictures. The film\\'s US box office performance had exceeded Go Fish Pictures\\' expectation.\\nInnocence received the 2004 Nihon SF Taisho Award. It was also in competition at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, making it the first and only anime in history to compete for the Palme d\\'Or. The soundtrack for the film was released under the name Innocence O.S.T. and a related novel called Ghost in the Shell: Innocence - After the Long Goodbye was released on February 29, 2004.\\n\\nPlot: The story is loosely based on Ghost in the Shell manga chapter \"Robot Rondo\" (with elements of \"Phantom Fund\"). Opening in 2032, Public Security Section 9 cybernetic operative Batou is teamed with Togusa, an agent with very few cybernetic upgrades, following the events of Ghost in the Shell.\\nAfter a series of deaths due to malfunctioning gynoids—doll-like sex robots—Section 9 is asked to investigate. As the gynoids all malfunctioned without clear cause, the deaths are believed to be premeditated murders; Batou and Togusa are sent to investigate possible terrorist or political motives. Additionally, the most recent gynoid\\'s remains show they all contained an illegal \"ghost\". Section 9 concludes human sentience is being artificially duplicated onto the dolls illegally, making the robots more lifelike, and possibly acting as a motive in the murders.\\nCalled to a homicide scene, information warfare/technology specialist Ishikawa explains the victim is Jack Walkson, a consignment officer at gynoid company LOCUS SOLUS, who may have been killed by the Yakuza. A previous Yakuza boss was recently killed by a gynoid, so Ishikawa concludes Walkson was held responsible and killed in an act of revenge. Batou and Togusa enter a Yakuza bar to question the current boss, only to be threatened by the bar occupants. Batou opens fire, killing and wounding numerous gang members, including the cyborg that murdered Walkson. The current boss then admits his predecessor was somehow involved in LOCUS SOLUS, but insists he doesn\\'t know how.\\nEntering a store on his way home, Batou is then seemingly warned by the Major and shot in the arm by an unseen assailant. Caught in a firefight, Batou nearly kills the store owner in confusion, but is subdued when Ishikawa appears. While having his damaged arm replaced, Batou is informed by Ishikawa that his e-brain was hacked, causing him to shoot himself and attack the store occupants. Ishikawa explains that Batou was hacked in order to cause further scandal following his Yakuza assault in an attempt to stop the Section 9 investigation.\\nBatou and Togusa then head for the mansion of Kim, a soldier-turned-hacker with an obsession with dolls. Seemingly dead, Kim soon reveals he \"lives\" inside the shell of a human-sized marionette, and discusses philosophy with his visitors. Kim admits ties to LOCUS SOLUS, divulging that the company has secret headquarters in international waters. Warned again by the Major, Batou realizes that Kim has secretly hacked into his and Togusa\\'s e-brains, and is currently trapping them in a false reality. Resetting Togusa\\'s brain, Batou subdues Kim, stating he knows Kim hacked his brain in the store.\\nResolved to gather material evidence, Batou infiltrates the LOCUS SOLUS headquarters ship while Togusa remotely hacks its security systems using an unaware Kim as a proxy. The ship\\'s security becomes aware of the hacking and retaliates with a virus that fries Kim\\'s cyberbrain. Simultaneously, a hidden virus loads a combat program into the production-line gynoids, causing them to attack everyone aboard, easily slaughtering the poorly armed and panicked security force. As Batou fights to the ship\\'s center, the Major then appears by controlling a gynoid remotely, helping Batou fight the gynoids and hack the ship\\'s security.\\nTaking control of the ship, the Major reveals to Batou the truth about the gynoids. Hiring the Yakuza to traffic young girls, LOCUS SOLUS duplicated their consciousnesses into the gynoids, giving them human \"ghosts\" to make them more realistic. Batou rescues a young girl from a \"ghost dubbing\" machine, and she explains that Jack Walkson, having learned the truth about LOCUS SOLUS, promised to save the girls by tampering with the ghosting process. This caused the gynoids to murder their owners, allowing Walkson to attract police attention and indirectly kill the Yakuza boss. Despite Walkson\\'s actions saving the girls, Batou objects that he also victimized the gynoids as well, causing them severe distress by giving them damaged ghosts. Having solved the case, Batou asks the Major if she\\'s happy now. She responds that she\\'ll always be beside him on the network, then disconnects from the gynoid.\\n'},\n",

Ellen wants to fly, but Clark insists on driving, so he can bond with his family. He has ordered a new car in preparation for the trip, but the dealer claims that it will not be ready for six weeks. Clark is forced to buy the \"Wagon Queen Family Truckster\", an ugly, oversized station wagon, after the car he brought to trade in has been hauled away and crushed.\\nDuring the family\\'s travels, they experience numerous mishaps, such as being tagged by vandals in St. Louis, Missouri. Clark aggravates a bartender in Dodge City, Kansas and is tantalized on numerous occasions by a beautiful young woman driving a flashy red Ferrari 308 GTS.\\nThey stop in Coolidge, Kansas to visit Ellen\\'s cousin Catherine and her husband Eddie, who foist cranky Aunt Edna and her mean dog Dinky on the Griswolds, asking them to drop her off at her son Norman\\'s home in Phoenix.\\nAfter stopping at a decrepit and dirty campground in South Fork, Colorado for the night, Clark forgets to untie Dinky\\'s leash from the rear bumper before driving off the next morning, killing the dog. A motorcycle cop pulls the Griswolds over and angrily lectures Clark over animal cruelty, but accepts Clark\\'s apology. Edna learns of her dog\\'s death and becomes more irate with Clark. Exiting Colorado, Ellen loses her bag which had her credit cards and Clark reports them as lost.\\nWhile Ellen and Clark argue during a drive between Utah and Arizona, they crash and become stranded in the desert near Monument Valley. Clark and Rusty have a bonding experience explaining why Clark wants to take this vacation. After setting off alone in the desert to look for help, Clark eventually reunites with his family, who have been rescued and taken to a local mechanic. The mechanic extorts Clark\\'s remaining cash only to render the car barely operational. Frustrated, they stop at the Grand Canyon. When Clark is unable to convince a hotel clerk to cash a personal check because his credit cards have mistakenly been reported lost, he raids the cash register behind the clerk\\'s back and leaves the check.\\nLeaving, they find that Aunt Edna has died in her sleep. They tie her corpse to the roof of the car, wrapped in a tarpaulin. Discovering that Norman is out of town when they arrive at his home, they attach a note to the corpse and leave it in his backyard. Ellen becomes annoyed at Clark\\'s hasty, halfhearted attempt at a eulogy.\\nOverwhelmed by the mishaps they have encountered during the road trip, Ellen and the children want to go back home, but Clark has become obsessed with reaching Walley World and they continue on. After an argument with Ellen, Clark eventually meets the Ferrari-driving blonde at a hotel bar. After telling the woman that Clark owns the motel chain, he goes skinny-dipping with her in its pool, but they are discovered by the family before anything intimate happens due to Clark’s loud remarks about the cold temperature. Clark eventually tells the woman the truth, and she leaves him understandingly. Clark later lies to Russ while trying to explain himself, explaining that the woman was just a waitress. Ellen forgives Clark and they go skinny-dipping themselves.\\nDespite the family\\'s misfortunes, they finally arrive at Walley World the next day only to discover the park closed for the next two weeks for repairs. Finally slipping into madness and realizing that all his efforts have been for nothing, Clark buys a realistic-looking BB gun and demands that park security guard Russ Lasky take them through Walley World. Ellen and the kids follow, attempting to placate Clark. Eventually, an LAPD SWAT team arrives and just as the family is about to be arrested, the park owner Roy Walley appears. Roy understands Clark\\'s impassioned longing to achieve the perfect vacation, bringing back memories of his own family vacation headaches. He decides not to file criminal charges against the Griswolds and lets the family – along with the SWAT team – enjoy the park as his guests.\\nA montage of snapshots taken during the trip is shown during the credits, ending with one that shows the Griswolds flying back to Chicago.\\n'},\n",

It debuted at the 45th International Venice Film Festival and was released on 11 November 1988.\\n\\nPlot: The actual Spanish title refers to an ataque de nervios (attack of the nerves), which is not actually well translated as \"nervous breakdown\" (crisis nerviosa). Ataques de nervios are culture-bound psychological phenomena during which the individual, most often female, displays dramatic outpouring of negative emotions, bodily gestures, occasional falling to the ground, and fainting, often in response to receiving disturbing news or witnessing or participating in an upsetting event. Historically, this condition has been associated with hysteria and more recently in the scientific literature with post-traumatic stress and panic attacks.[6]\\n'},\n",

She begins a story with the birth of a girl named Tita. Tita's mother, Elena, gives birth on the kitchen table, assisted by the cook, Nacha. Shortly afterwards Elena's husband dies of a heart attack when a stranger viciously tells him that his wife had an affair and the second daughter isn't his. During the funeral Elena explains to Nacha that she can no longer have children and the family tradition dictates that Tita, being the youngest child, cannot marry but must take care of her mother until her death. Tita's sisters, Rosaura and Gertrudis, will be allowed to marry. Nacha takes charge of teaching Tita how to cook food in flavorful ways. Tita learns to infuse her emotions into food.\\nYears later a young man named Pedro Muzquiz professes his love and desire to marry Tita, who feels the same way about Pedro. On Tita's birthday, Pedro arrives with his father, Don Pascual Muzquiz, to ask for her hand. Elena explains why Tita is not allowed to marry and offers Rosaura instead. Rosaura is delighted, Tita is devastated and Gertrudis and Chencha (a maid) are disappointed. Nacha overhears Pedro tell his father that he is marrying Rosaura only in order to stay close to Tita. Nacha tells Tita but she is too upset to believe it. While baking the wedding cake Tita cries into the batter. During the wedding reception Pedro tells Tita of his true feelings. Suspicious that Tita and Pedro are having an affair, Elena says Tita must stay away from Pedro. As the guests eat the wedding cake, everyone is overcome with great sadness for lost lovers and begins to cry, followed by vomiting. Overcome with this sadness Elena rushes to her bedroom and tearfully looks at the photo of a well-dressed mulatto man. It is implied that the rumours about Elena's affair are true. Tita finds Nacha dead on the floor holding a picture of her husband.\\nSome time later Rosaura becomes pregnant. One day Pedro brings Tita a bouquet of roses to celebrate Tita being the head cook. Elena commands Tita to throw them away but Tita uses the petals to create a rose sauce for a quail dish. While eating the meal everyone except Rosaura becomes filled with sensual gratification. Rosaura is sick instead and leaves the table. Gertrudis becomes hot and so overheated that the shower house catches fire. She runs away naked, encountering the soldier Juan Alejandrez, who is fighting in the Mexican Revolution. Filled with a strong attraction to Juan, Gertrudis immediately jumps onto his horse and leaves with him. Tita sees this but tells Elena that Gertrudis was kidnapped and the soldiers set the shower house on fire. Elena is informed by a family priest that Gertrudis was forced into prostitution. Tita secretly sends Gertrudis her things.\\nRosaura gives birth to a sickly son, Roberto. Too ill to nurse Roberto, she must let Tita nurse him with Pedro monitoring. Still suspicious that Tita and Pedro are having an affair, Elena sends Rosaura, Pedro and Roberto to live in Texas. Months later Chencha informs Elena and Tita that Roberto, unwilling to eat, has died. Tita is greatly saddened, but Elena tells her to show no emotion and to continue with the kitchen chores. This brings Tita to an angry outburst and Elena slapping her with a wooden spoon, resulting in a nose bleed. Tita runs into the dovecote and Elena threatens to have the ladder taken down.\\nFor Tita, her rite of separation is the physical removal of her person from Elena's oppressive domination and into the dovecote, where she inhabits a state of nothingness for a period of seven days. After a week of being in the dovecote, Tita is rescued by John Brown, a family doctor, who takes her to his home in Texas for treatment. Tita's rite of transition occurs with this rescue by Dr. Brown, where she eats the healing soup he has made for her and learns of the tunnel of light that she later encounters at the end of the film. Chencha goes to visit Tita and is shocked that she has recovered. Tita tells Chencha to tell Elena that she is never coming back to the ranch. Doctor Brown, who has fallen in love with Tita, proposes marriage and Tita accepts.\\nBack at the ranch, a group of bandits invade the property, rape Chencha and kill Elena by pushing her off a cliff. Tita and Doctor Brown return to the ranch to prepare Elena's funeral. While dressing Elena's body, Tita discovers the locket and jewelry box containing the picture of Elena's lover. Tita's rite of incorporation occurs when she returns to the ranch with her new found freedom from Elena, where she discovers the locket her mother had been hiding, which contained pictures of another man. Pedro and Rosaura, now pregnant again, return for Elena's funeral, and Rosaura's water breaks. Rosaura has a difficult labor but gives birth to a healthy baby girl named Esperanza. However, Esperanza refuses to be fed by Rosaura, so Tita once again takes on the duties of nursing. Due to complications in childbirth, Rosaura is no longer able to bear children. To Tita and Pedro's dismay, Rosaura imposes the family tradition on Esperanza. Upon finding out about Tita's engagement to Doctor Brown, Pedro becomes jealous, and he sneaks into Tita's room to have sex with her.\\nDuring a large social dinner Gertrudis, now a military General, returns to the ranch with Juan Alejandrez, now her husband, along with their squad. Due to her guilt Tita begins to have illusions of Elena chastising her for sleeping with Pedro. Tita suspects that she is pregnant with Pedro's child, and tells Gertrudis her concerns. Gertrudis advises Tita to tell Pedro. Gertrudis reminds Tita that the love she and Pedro share is true and that Rosaura's feelings are irrelevant because she knew that Tita was in love with Pedro but married him anyway. Tita is once again confronted with an illusion of Elena berating her. This time Tita stands up to Elena, confronting her about her affair and then banishing her. While singing up to Tita's window with Juan, Pedro catches on fire. Tita treats Pedro's wounds until Doctor Brown shows up. Pedro, still jealous of Tita's engagement with Doctor Brown, wants her to break it off and threatens to tell Doctor Brown about their one-night stand and her pregnancy. Tita tells Pedro she's not pregnant; it was a false alarm. However, out of guilt, Tita tells Doctor Brown of her infidelity and apologizes for hurting him. Doctor Brown accepts her apology and states that he still wants to be with her, but he will accept whatever decision she makes of their relationship. Rosaura confronts Tita about her relationship with Pedro. Rosaura threatens to kick Tita off the ranch if she goes anywhere near her daughter Esperanza, and dictates that Esperanza will never marry per family tradition.\\nMany years later, Esperanza marries Doctor Brown's son. It is revealed through gossip that Tita stayed on the ranch to fight for Esperanza's right to marry and Pedro woke up to find Rosaura dead from an unknown gastro-intestinal illness, releasing Esperanza from the family tradition.\\nPedro tells Tita that, with Esperanza married off, they can rekindle their romance. After the wedding they both go to the guest house to make love. While having sex, Pedro has a heart attack and dies. Devastated, Tita commits suicide by swallowing matches, causing her body to spontaneously combust and the room to catch on fire, which spreads throughout the entire property.\\nThe young woman narrating the whole story reveals that she is the daughter of Esperanza. She reveals that when Esperanza returned home from her honeymoon to find the property burned to ashes, she discovered Tita's cook book, which she kept and passed down to her daughter.\\n\"},\n",

It stars Jean Reno and Gary Oldman, and features the film debut of Natalie Portman. The plot centers on Léon (Reno), a professional hitman who reluctantly takes in twelve-year-old Mathilda Lando (Portman) after her family is murdered by corrupt Drug Enforcement Administration agent Norman Stansfield (Oldman). Léon and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his protégée and learns the hitman\\'s trade. The film was released in France by Gaumont and internationally through Gaumont Buena Vista International on 14 September 1994, and received positive reviews from critics.\\n\\nPlot: Léon is an Italian hitman (or \"cleaner\", as he refers to himself) in the Little Italy neighborhood of New York City working for a mafioso named \"Old Tony\". One day, Léon meets Mathilda Lando, a lonely twelve-year-old who lives with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hall from Léon, and has stopped attending class at her school for troubled girls. Mathilda\\'s abusive father attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who have been paying him to stash cocaine in his apartment. After they discover that he has been stealing the cocaine, DEA\\xa0agents storm the building, led by their boss, the sharply dressed drug-addict Norman Stansfield. During the raid, Stansfield murders Mathilda\\'s family while she is out shopping for groceries. When she returns, Mathilda realizes what has happened just in time to continue down the hall to Léon\\'s apartment; he hesitantly gives her shelter.\\nMathilda quickly discovers that Léon is a hitman. She begs him to take care of her and to teach her his skills, as she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother. At first, Léon is unsettled by her presence and considers murdering her in her sleep but he eventually trains Mathilda and shows her how to use various weapons. In exchange, she runs his errands, cleans his apartment and teaches him how to read. Mathilda looks up to Léon and quickly develops a crush on him, often telling him she loves him but he does not reciprocate.\\nWhen Léon is out on a job, Mathilda fills a bag with guns from Léon\\'s collection and sets out to kill Stansfield. She bluffs her way into the DEA office by posing as a delivery girl, and is ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom. One of his men arrives and informs him that Léon killed Malky, one of the corrupt DEA agents, in Chinatown that morning.

When Léon was eighteen in Italy, he fell  in love with a girl from a wealthy family, but Léon\\'s family was poor. The two made plans to elope but when the girl\\'s father discovered them, he killed her out of anger. Léon killed the father in revenge and fled to New York, where he met Tony and trained to become a hitman.\\nLater, while Mathilda returns home from grocery shopping, an NYPD ESU team sent by Stansfield captures her and infiltrates Léon\\'s apartment. Léon ambushes the ESU team and rescues Mathilda. Léon creates a quick escape for Mathilda by smashing a hole in an air shaft. He tells her that he loves her and to meet him at Tony\\'s place in an hour, moments before the ESU team blow up the apartment. In the chaos, a wounded Léon sneaks out of the building disguised as a wounded ESU officer. He goes unnoticed by everyone except Stansfield, who follows him and shoots him in the back. As Léon dies, he presses a grenade pin in Stansfield\\'s palm, saying that it is from Mathilda. Stansfield opens Léon\\'s vest to find a cluster of grenades, which detonate, killing Stansfield.\\nMathilda goes to Tony and tries to convince him to hire her, but Tony flatly refuses to hire a twelve-year-old and tells Mathilda that Léon told him to give his money to her if anything happened to him. Tony gives Mathilda $100 as an allowance and sends her back to school, where the headmistress re-admits her after Mathilda reveals what has happened. Mathilda walks onto a field near the school to plant Léon\\'s houseplant, as she had told Léon, to \"give it roots\".\\n'},\n",

The film is based on the X-Men superhero team appearing in Marvel Comics. It is the sequel to X-Men (2000), as well as the second installment in the X-Men film series, and features an ensemble cast including Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, Bruce Davison, Shawn Ashmore, Aaron Stanford, Kelly Hu, and Anna Paquin. Its plot, inspired by the graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills, concerns the genocidal Colonel William Stryker leading an assault on Professor Xavier's school to build his own version of Xavier's mutant-tracking computer, Cerebro, in order to destroy every mutant on Earth and to save the human race from them, forcing the X-Men to team up with the Brotherhood of Mutants, their former enemies, to stop Stryker and save the mutant race.\\nDevelopment on the sequel began shortly after the first film was released on July 14, 2000 by 20th Century Fox. David Hayter and Zak Penn wrote separate scripts, combining what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay. Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris were eventually hired to rewrite the work, and changed the characterizations of Beast, Angel, and Lady Deathstrike. Sentinels and the Danger Room were set to appear before being deleted because of budget concerns from Fox. The film's premise was influenced by the Marvel Comics storylines Return to Weapon X and God Loves, Man Kills. Filming began in June 2002 and ended that November, mostly taking place at Vancouver Film Studios, the largest North American production facility outside of Los Angeles.

A sequel, X-Men: The Last Stand, was released on May 26, 2006.\\n\\nPlot: At the White House, brainwashed teleporting mutant Nightcrawler attacks the President of the United States, wounding many agents. He is shot and retreats. Meanwhile, Logan explores an abandoned military installation at Alkali Lake in Alberta for clues to his past, but finds nothing. Jean Grey has been having premonitions and struggles to concentrate as her powers become increasingly difficult to control. Later, Logan returns to Professor Xavier's school for mutants, and Xavier tracks Nightcrawler using Cerebro. Xavier and Cyclops go to question the imprisoned Magneto about the attack, while X-Men Storm and Jean Grey retrieve Nightcrawler. Military scientist Colonel William Stryker approaches the president and receives approval to investigate Xavier's mansion for their ties to mutants in the wake of the recent attack. Stryker's forces invade the school and abduct some of the students. Colossus leads the remaining students to safety while Logan, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro escape, and Stryker's assistant Yuriko Oyama captures Cyclops and Xavier. During the attack, Logan confronts Stryker, who addresses him as Wolverine and seems to know about his past.\\nThe shape-shifting Mystique gains information about Magneto's prison and helps him escape while also discovering schematics for a second Cerebro. Logan, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro visit Iceman's parents and brother in Boston and meet up with Storm, Jean, and Nightcrawler. The X-Jet is attacked by fighter jets while flying back to the mansion and is shot down, but Magneto saves them from crashing. Magneto explains to the group that Stryker has built the second Cerebro to use it and Xavier to telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. Stryker's son, Jason, is a mutant with mind-controlling powers, whom Stryker will use to force Xavier to do this. Stryker had also previously used Jason's powers to orchestrate Nightcrawler's attack as a pretense to gain approval to invade Xavier's mansion. Magneto also tells Wolverine that Stryker was the man who grafted his adamantium skeleton onto his bones and is responsible for his amnesia. Jean reads Nightcrawler's mind and determines that Stryker's base is underground in a dam at Alkali Lake.\\nDisguised as Logan, Mystique infiltrates Stryker's base. She lets the rest of the mutants in and Magneto and Mystique go to disable Cerebro before the brainwashed Xavier can activate it. Storm and Nightcrawler rescue the captured students, and Jean fights a mind-controlled Cyclops; their battle frees Cyclops but damages the dam, which begins to rupture. Logan finds Stryker in an adamantium smelting lab and remembers it as where he received his adamantium skeleton. Logan fights and kills Yuriko, then chases Stryker to a helicopter pad and chains him to the helicopter's wheel. Magneto stops Cerebro and, using Mystique impersonating Stryker to command Jason, has Xavier redirect its powers on humans. The two subsequently use Stryker's helicopter to escape, accompanied by Pyro, who has been swayed to Magneto's views. Nightcrawler teleports Storm inside Cerebro, where she creates a snowstorm to break Jason's concentration and free Xavier from his control.\\nThe X-Men flee the dam as water engulfs it, killing Stryker, but the X-Jet loses all power and struggles to take flight as the flood water rushes towards them. Jean sneaks off the jet and telepathically wishes the team goodbye. She holds back the water and raises the jet above it as flames erupt from her body, until she lets go and allows the flood to crash down upon her, presumably killing her. The X-Men give Stryker's files to the president, and Xavier warns him that humans and mutants must work together to build peace. Back at the school, Xavier, Cyclops, and Logan remember Jean, and Xavier begins to hold a class. Meanwhile, a Phoenix-like shape rises from the flooded Alkali Lake.\\n\"},\n",

It is the sequel to Fast & Furious (2009) and the fifth installment in the Fast & Furious franchise. The film stars Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto and Paul Walker as Brian O\\'Conner, alongside Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang and Dwayne Johnson. In the film, Dom and Brian, along with Dom\\'s sister Mia (Brewster) plan a heist to steal $100 million from corrupt businessman Hernan Reyes (Almeida) while being pursued for arrest by U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson).\\nWhile developing Fast Five, Universal Pictures deliberately departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as brawls, gun fights, and the central heist. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, with the film being advertised through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.\\nLin, Diesel, and Walker\\'s returns were finalized in February 2010. Principal photography began that July and lasted until that October, with filming locations including Atlanta, Puerto Rico, and Rio de Janeiro. Brian Tyler, the composer of the previous two installments, returned to compose the score. The film is notable for primarily featuring practical stunt work as opposed to computer-generated imagery.\\nFast Five premiered at the Cinépolis Lagoon in Rio de Janeiro on April 15, 2011, and was released in the United States on April 29, by Universal Pictures. The film received  positive reviews, with praise for Lin\\'s direction, the action sequences, and the performances of the cast; it is widely considered one of the best films in the franchise. Fast Five grossed $626 million worldwide, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2011, the then-highest-grossing film in the franchise, and set several records related to Universal\\'s highest-grossing opening weekend in several international markets. It was followed by Fast & Furious 6 in 2013.\\n\\nPlot: As Dominic Toretto is being transported by bus to Lompoc Prison,[a] his sister Mia Toretto and friend Brian O\\'Conner lead an assault on the bus and free Dom. While the authorities search for them, the trio escapes to Rio de Janeiro. Awaiting Dom\\'s arrival, Mia and Brian join their friend Vince and other participants on a job to steal three cars from a train. Brian and Mia learn that agents from the DEA are on the train and that the cars are seized property. When Dom arrives with his accomplices, he realizes that their leader Zizi is only interested in stealing the Ford GT40. Dom has Mia steal the car herself before he and Brian fight Zizi and his henchmen, during which Zizi kills the DEA Agents. Brian and Dom are captured and brought to drug lord Hernan Reyes, the owner of the cars and Zizi\\'s boss. Reyes orders the pair interrogated to discover the car\\'s location, but they escape to their safehouse.\\nDom, Brian, and Mia are framed as the murderers of the DEA Agents, and the U.S. government sends a team of Diplomatic Security Service Agents, led by DSS Agent Luke Hobbs and assisted by local officer Elena Neves, to Rio to arrest them. While Brian, Dom, and Mia examine the car to discover its importance, Vince arrives and is caught removing a computer chip from it. He admits he was planning to sell the chip to Reyes, and Dom angrily forces him to leave. Brian discovers the chip contains financial details of Reyes\\' criminal empire, including the locations of US$100 million in cash. Hobbs and his team arrive at Dom\\'s safehouse, but find it under assault by Reyes\\' men searching for the chip. Brian, Dom and Mia escape after a chase across the favelas. Dom suggests they split up and leave Rio, but Mia announces she is pregnant with Brian\\'s child. Dom agrees to stick together, suggesting they steal Reyes\\' money to start a new life. They organize a team to perform the heist: Han, Roman, Tej, Gisele, Leo, and Santos.\\nTo centralize the cash, Dom\\'s team attacks one of the locations and burns the money in front of Reyes\\' staff. Afraid of further attacks, Reyes consolidates the remaining money in an evidence vault inside a police station. Dom\\'s team does surveillance, buys equipment, and acquires Reyes\\' handprint. After their fastest cars prove to be too slow for security cameras, they steal four 2010 Dodge Charger police cars to blend in. Vince rejoins Dom\\'s team after saving Mia from Reyes\\' men. Hobbs\\' team eventually finds and arrests Dom, Mia, Brian, and Vince. While transporting them for extradition to the United States in a Gurkha LAPV, the convoy is attacked by Reyes\\' men. Dom, Brian, Mia, and Vince help Hobbs and Elena escape the ambush, but the rest of Hobbs\\' men and Vince are killed. Enraged at their team\\'s deaths, Hobbs and Elena agree to help with the heist. The gang breaks into the police station with the LAPV and uses two of the Chargers to tear the vault holding Reyes\\' money from the building, dragging it through the city.\\nAdvancing on the bridge after an extensive police chase, Dom has Brian continue without him while he smashes the police and Reyes\\' vehicles with the vault. Brian returns and kills Zizi. Hobbs arrives and executes the injured Reyes in retribution for his team. Hobbs gives Dom and Brian a 24-hour head start to escape on the condition they leave the vault as it is.

       "  'Description': 'Wild Strawberries is a 1957 Swedish drama film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. The original Swedish title is Smultronstället, which literally means \"the wild strawberry patch\" but idiomatically signifies a hidden gem of a place, often with personal or sentimental value, and not widely known. The cast includes Victor Sjöström in his final screen performance as an old man recalling his past, as well as Bergman regulars Bibi Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, and Gunnar Björnstrand. Max von Sydow also appears in a small role.\\nBergman wrote the screenplay while hospitalized.[1] Exploring philosophical themes such as introspection and human existence, Wild Strawberries received wide positive domestic reception upon release, and won the Golden Bear for Best Film at the 8th Berlin International Film Festival. It is often considered to be Bergman\\'s greatest and most moving film and one of the greatest films ever made.[2]\\n\\nPlot: Grouchy, stubborn, and egotistical Professor Isak Borg is a widowed 78-year-old physician who specialized in bacteriology. Before specializing, he served as a general practitioner in rural Sweden. He sets out on a long car ride from Stockholm to Lund to be awarded the degree of Doctor Jubilaris 50 years after he received his doctorate from Lund University. He is accompanied by his pregnant daughter-in-law Marianne who does not much like her father-in-law and is planning to separate from her husband, Evald, Isak\\'s only son. Evald does not want her to have the baby, their first.\\nDuring the trip, Isak is forced by nightmares, daydreams, old age, and impending death to reevaluate his life. He meets a series of hitchhikers, each of whom sets off dreams or reveries into Borg\\'s troubled past. The first group consists of two young men and their companion, a woman named Sara who is adored by both men. Sara is a double for the love of Isak\\'s youth. He reminisces about his childhood at the seaside and his sweetheart Sara, with whom he remembered gathering strawberries, but who instead married his brother. The first group remains with him throughout his journey. Next Isak and Marianne pick up an embittered middle-aged couple, the Almans, whose vehicle had nearly collided with theirs. The pair exchanges such terrible vitriol and venom that Marianne stops the car and demands that they leave. The couple reminds Isak of his own unhappy marriage. In a dream sequence, Isak is asked by Sten Alman, now the examiner, to read \"foreign\" letters on the blackboard. He cannot. So, Alman reads it for him: \"A doctor\\'s first duty is to ask forgiveness,\" from which he concludes, \"You are guilty of guilt.\"[3]\\nHe is confronted by his loneliness and aloofness, recognizing these traits in both his elderly mother (whom they stop to visit) and in his middle-aged physician son, and he gradually begins to accept himself, his past, his present, and his approaching death.[4][5][6]\\nBorg finally arrives at his destination and is promoted to Doctor Jubilaris, but this proves to be an empty ritual. That night, he bids a loving goodbye to his young friends, to whom the once bitter old man whispers in response to a playful declaration of the young girl\\'s love, \"I\\'ll remember.\" As he goes to his bed in his son\\'s home, he is overcome by a sense of peace, and dreams of a family picnic by a lake. Closure and affirmation of life have finally come, and Borg\\'s face radiates joy.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'Howl\\'s Moving Castle (Japanese: ハウルの動く城, Hepburn: Hauru no Ugoku Shiro) is a 2004 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It is loosely based on the 1986 novel of the same name by British author Diana Wynne Jones. The film was produced by Toshio Suzuki, animated by Studio Ghibli and distributed by Toho. The Japanese voice cast featured Chieko Baisho and Takuya Kimura, while the English dub version starred Jean Simmons, Emily Mortimer, Lauren Bacall, Christian Bale, Josh Hutcherson and Billy Crystal. The film is set in a fictional kingdom where both magic and early twentieth-century technology are prevalent, against the backdrop of a war with another kingdom. It tells the story of Sophie, a young milliner who is turned into an elderly woman by a witch who enters her shop and curses her. She encounters a wizard named Howl and gets caught up in his resistance to fighting for the king.\\nInfluenced by Miyazaki\\'s opposition to the United States\\' invasion of Iraq in 2003, the film contains strong anti-war themes. Miyazaki stated that he \"had a great deal of rage\" about the Iraq war, which led him to make a film which he felt would be poorly received in the United States.[5] It also explores the theme of old age, depicting age positively as something which grants the protagonist freedom. The film contains feminist elements as well, and carries messages about the value of compassion. In 2013, Miyazaki said Howl\\'s Moving Castle was his favorite creation, explaining, \"I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don\\'t think that\\'s changed.\"[6] The film is significantly thematically different from the novel; while the novel focuses on challenging class and gender norms, the film focuses on love, personal loyalty and the destructive effects of war.[7]\\nHowl\\'s Moving Castle premiered at the 61st Venice International Film Festival on 5 September 2004, and was theatrically released in Japan on 20 November 2004. It went on to gross $190 million in Japan and $236 million worldwide, making it one of the most commercially successful Japanese films in history. The film received critical acclaim, with particular praise toward its visuals and Miyazaki\\'s presentation of the themes. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 78th Academy Awards, but lost to Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, in 2006, and won several other awards, including four Tokyo Anime Awards and a Nebula Award for Best Script.\\n\\nPlot: Sophie, a young milliner and eldest of three sisters, encounters a wizard named Howl on her way to visit her sister Lettie. Upon returning home, she meets the Witch of the Waste, who transforms her into a 90-year-old woman. Seeking to break the curse, Sophie leaves home and sets off through the countryside. She meets a living scarecrow, whom she calls \"Turnip Head\". He leads her to Howl\\'s moving castle where she enters without invitation. She subsequently meets Howl\\'s young apprentice Markl and a fire demon named Calcifer, the source of the castle\\'s magic and movement. Calcifer makes a deal with Sophie, agreeing to break her curse if she breaks his link with Howl. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that she has \"hired herself\" as a cleaning lady.\\nMeanwhile, Sophie\\'s nation is caught up in a war with a neighboring kingdom, which is searching for its missing prince. The King summons Howl to fight in the war. However, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King, under the pretense of being his mother, to tell him that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives Sophie a charmed ring that leads her to Calcifer and guarantees her safety. Sophie meets Suliman, the king\\'s head sorceress, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power and reverting her to her true age, that of a harmless old woman. Suliman warns Sophie that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight for the king. Howl then arrives to rescue Sophie. Suliman tries to trap him by turning him into a monster, but with Sophie\\'s help he remembers himself and just barely avoids death. The duo escapes along with the former Witch of the Waste and Suliman\\'s dog Heen. In the meantime, soldiers from each kingdom break into the homes of both Jenkins and Pendragon (Howl\\'s aliases in those kingdoms). However, the men only find an empty courtyard and warehouse, as the castle\\'s magic nature allows travel between four separate residences.\\nSophie learns that Howl\\'s life is somehow bound to Calcifer\\'s and that Howl has been transforming into a bird-like creature to interfere with both sides in the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human form. Howl then has the castle magically linked to Sophie\\'s home, parking the castle itself on the town\\'s outskirts. A few days later, the town is bombed by enemy aircraft and Suliman\\'s henchmen attack the house and Sophie\\'s hat shop. Howl heads out to protect the group. Sophie then moves everyone out of the house and removes Calcifer from the fireplace, which collapses the castle. The Witch of the Waste realizes that Calcifer has Howl\\'s heart and grabs the fire demon, setting herself on fire. Sophie panics and pours water onto the Witch, which douses Calcifer. The remainder of the castle then splits in two; Sophie falls down a chasm and is separated from the group.\\nFollowing the charmed ring, Sophie wanders into a scene from the past, where she sees a young Howl catch a falling star – Calcifer – and gives him his heart. Sophie calls for them to find her in the future as she is teleported away. She returns to the present, finds Howl, and they reunite with the others. The Witch returns Howl\\'s heart, and Sophie places it back inside Howl, reviving him and freeing Calcifer, though he decides to stay. Sophie\\'s curse is broken, though her hair remains white. After she kisses Turnip Head on the cheek, he returns to human form revealing himself to be Justin, the missing prince from the enemy kingdom. He reveals that only his true love\\'s kiss can break his curse. After seeing Sophie\\'s affection lies with Howl, he promptly heads for home to cease the war, but promises he will see them again. Suliman, watching through a crystal globe, also decides to end the war. Sometime later, bombers fly under dark skies over a recovered and green countryside headed to another war, while Sophie, Howl, and the others travel in the opposite direction in a new flying castle.\\n'},\n",

It stars John Belushi, Tim Matheson, John Vernon, Verna Bloom, Thomas Hulce, Stephen Furst, and Donald Sutherland. The film is about a trouble-making fraternity whose members challenge the authority of the dean of the fictional Faber College.\\nProduced by Matty Simmons of National Lampoon and Ivan Reitman for Universal Pictures, it was inspired by stories written by Miller and published in National Lampoon, which were based on Ramis\\' experience in the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity at Washington University in St. Louis, Miller\\'s Alpha Delta Phi experiences at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, and producer Reitman\\'s at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.\\nOf the younger lead actors, only the 28-year-old Belushi was an established star, but even he had not yet appeared in a film, having gained fame as an original cast member of Saturday Night Live, which was in its third season in the autumn of 1977. Several of the actors who were cast as college students, including Thomas Hulce, Karen Allen, and Kevin Bacon, were just beginning their film careers. Matheson, also cast as a student, was already a seasoned actor, having appeared in movies and television since the age of 13.\\nFilming took place at the University of Oregon[5] from October to December 1977. Following its initial release on July 28, 1978, Animal House received generally mixed reviews from critics, but Time and Roger Ebert proclaimed it one of the year\\'s best. Filmed for only $3 million, it garnered an estimated gross of more than $141 million in the form of theatrical rentals and home video, not including merchandising, making it the highest grossing comedy film of its time.[4][6]\\nThe film, along with 1977\\'s The Kentucky Fried Movie, also directed by Landis, was largely responsible for defining and launching the gross out film genre, which became one of Hollywood\\'s staples.[7] Animal House is now regarded as one of the best comedy films of all time.[8][9][10][11]\\nIn 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed National Lampoon\\'s Animal House \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. It was No. 1 on Bravo\\'s \"100 Funniest Movies\". It was No. 36 on AFI\\'s \"100 Years... 100 Laughs\" list of the 100 best American comedies. In 2008, Empire magazine selected it as No. 279 of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\".\\n\\nPlot: In Fall 1962, Faber College freshmen Larry Kroger and Kent Dorfman seek to pledge a fraternity. Finding themselves ostracized at the prestigious Omega Theta Pi house party, the two visit the Delta Tau Chi house next door; Kent believes he cannot be rejected because his older brother Fred was a member, making him a \"legacy.\" During the party, they meet the slovenly John Blutarsky (\"Bluto\"), chapter president Robert Hoover (\"Hoov\"), smooth-talking Eric Stratton (\"Otter\") and his best friend Donald Schoenstein (\"Boon\"), motorcyclist Daniel Simpson Day (\"D-Day\"), and Boon\\'s girlfriend Katy. Larry and Kent are accepted as Delta pledges and given the fraternity names \"Pinto\" and \"Flounder,\" respectively. Meanwhile, Chip Diller is accepted into Omega house and given a paddling to show his allegiance. \\nDelta is on probation due to campus conduct violations and poor academic standing. Wanting to remove the fraternity from campus, Dean Vernon Wormer directs Greg Marmalard, the smug Omega president, to find a justification for him to do so. Greg also has private reasons to be resentful of his fellow students, as his puzzled girlfriend has pointed out to him that a key part of his body is not responding to her. Various incidents deepen the animosity between Delta, Omega, and Wormer, including the prank-related accidental death of a horse that belongs to Omega member and ROTC Cadet Commander Douglas C. Neidermeyer, who has been bullying Flounder, as well as Otter flirting with Marmalard\\'s girlfriend, Mandy Pepperidge, who Otter had previously slept with. \\nBluto and D-Day steal the answer key to an upcoming psychology test from the trash, unaware that the Omegas have switched it for a fake. The Deltas all fail and their grade-point averages drop so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter and have them permanently dismissed from campus. To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party and recruit Pinto and Flounder to shoplift food for it from a supermarket. There, Pinto meets a pretty young cashier named Clorette and invites her, while Otter invites Wormer\\'s alcoholic, lecherous wife Marion. During the party, at which Otis Day and the Knights perform, Otter has sex with Marion, while Clorette makes out with Pinto until she passes out drunk. Pinto resists the temptation to have sex with her and instead takes her home in a shopping cart. He later discovers that she is the 13-year-old daughter of Carmine DePasto, the town mayor.\\nOutraged by Marion\\'s escapades and threatened with personal harm by DePasto, Wormer organizes a kangaroo court with the Omegas and revokes the Deltas\\' charter, confiscating the entire contents of their house. To clear their heads, Otter, Boon, Pinto and Flounder take a road trip in Fred\\'s car. They visit an all-girls\\' college, where Otter poses as the fiancé of a student who has recently died in order to find dates for himself and the others. They stop at a roadhouse bar where the Knights are performing, unaware that the clientele is exclusively African-American. Two of the patrons intimidate the Deltas into abandoning their dates and fleeing, during which Fred\\'s car is heavily damaged.\\nBoon breaks up with Katy after discovering her sexual relationship with a professor, while Marmalard and other Omegas lure Otter to a motel and assault him, acting on a fabricated claim that Otter and Mandy have been seeing each other. Due to the Deltas\\' dismal midterm grades, Wormer gleefully expels them from Faber and notifies their local draft boards that they have lost their student deferments and are now eligible for military service. With Otter\\'s support, Bluto rallies the Deltas to get revenge on Wormer, the Omegas, and the entire college during the annual homecoming parade. D-Day converts Fred\\'s damaged car into an armored vehicle, which they conceal inside a cake-shaped breakaway float and sneak into the parade. The Deltas then sabotage all aspects of the parade and crash into the reviewing stand, collapsing it.\\nAs chaos ensues, the futures of several of the characters are revealed. Many of the Deltas become respectable professionals, while the Omegas and the other adversaries suffer less fortunate outcomes; most notably, Neidermeyer is killed in Vietnam by his own troops, and Marmalard becomes an aide to President Nixon but is later raped in prison in 1974.\\n'},\n",

Carlos, a friendly local resident, gives Nancy a ride and drops her off at the beach, while a friend of hers who came along with her is staying back at a hotel after partying too much. Nancy joins two other locals and the three surf for several hours. Taking a break from surfing, Nancy video-chats with her younger sister Chloe. When she talks to her father in an emotional and strained conversation, it is revealed that her mother's death caused Nancy to consider dropping out of medical school.\\nWhile surfing one last time for the day, Nancy notices the carcass of a young humpback whale nearby. As she rides the last wave back to the beach, a large 23\\xa0ft (7.0\\xa0m) great white shark knocks her off her surfboard and bites her leg. Nancy climbs onto the whale carcass, but the shark rams it from underneath, forcing her to swim to an isolated rock. She uses her surfboard leash to slow the bleeding from her leg. Later she uses her jewelry to put rudimentary stitches in place to hold her torn flesh together. Nancy is left alone when the unaware locals leave the beach, and she spends the night on the rock with a wounded gull, which was also injured by the shark, and names him Steven Seagull. The next morning, a drunk local man on the beach steals Nancy's belongings. While wading out into the shallow water to steal Nancy's surfboard, however, he is killed by the shark. Several hours later, the two locals Nancy had surfed with the day before return. They get into the water before Nancy can warn them away, and are also killed by the shark.\\nOne of the local surfers was wearing a GoPro camera on his helmet. When he was attacked by the shark, his helmet had come off and floated to the surface. Nancy later sees the helmet floating in the water. After some struggle, she is able to retrieve it and notices in the footage of the attack, the shark has a large hook stuck in its mouth after a possible encounter with fishermen. Nancy uses the GoPro to leave messages for her sister and father as well as information about the shark attack and her location.\\nWith high tide approaching, Nancy realizes the rock will be submerged soon. After sending Steven Seagull toward shore on a piece of the surfboard, and timing the shark's circles from the whale carcass to the rock, Nancy swims to a nearby buoy, narrowly avoiding the shark by swimming through a group of jellyfish, which sting both the shark and her. Nancy finds a flare gun on the buoy. She shoots one flare to draw the attention of a faraway cargo ship, but the ship has already turned away and does not see her. She then fires another flare at the shark, setting the oil from the whale carcass alight and angering it, but otherwise having no effect. The shark then ferociously attacks the buoy and rips out the chains securing it to the ocean bed. Nancy straps herself to the last remaining chain and as it is ripped from the buoy, she is pulled down to the ocean floor, pursued by the shark. At the last moment, Nancy pulls out of the dive, and the shark impales itself on rebar protruding from the buoy's anchor.\\nLater, a boy named Miguel (from the opening of the film at the beach) finds the GoPro and informs his father, then revealed to be Carlos. Carlos finds Nancy floating close to shore and revives her. Nancy briefly sees a hallucination of her mother. As she looks around the beach, she sees that Steven Seagull has made it to the shore.

It stars Mario Adorf, Angela Winkler, Daniel Olbrychski, Katharina Thalbach, Charles Aznavour, and David Bennent in the lead role of Oskar Matzerath, a young boy who willfully arrests his own physical development and remains in the body of a child even as he enters adulthood.\\nA darkly comic war drama with magical realist elements, the film follows Oskar, a precocious child living in Danzig, who wields seemingly preternatural abilities. He lives in contempt of the adults around him and witnesses firsthand their potential for cruelty, first via the rise of the Nazi Party and then the subsequent war. The title refers to Oskar's toy drum, which he loudly plays whenever he is displeased or upset. The German-language film was a co-production of West German, French, and Yugoslavian companies.\\nThe film won the Palme d'Or at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival and was a major financial hit in West Germany, where it won the German Film Award for Best Fiction Film. It was received more controversially internationally, targeted by censorship campaigns in Ireland, Canada, and the United States. Despite the notoriety, the film won Best Foreign Language Film at the 1980 Academy Awards. In 2003, The New York Times placed the film on its Best 1000 Movies Ever list.[5]\\n\\nPlot: The film centres on Oskar Matzerath, a boy born and raised in the Free City of Danzig prior to and during World War II, who recalls the story's events as an unreliable narrator. Oskar is the son of a half-Polish Kashubian woman, Agnes Bronski, who is married to a German chef named Alfred Matzerath but secretly carrying on an affair with Jan, a Polish Post Office worker and her cousin. The two men are great friends, but Alfred is blissfully unaware of his wife's infidelity. Oskar's parentage is uncertain; though he himself believes he is Jan's son.\\nFlashbacks reveal his mother's conception by his grandfather Joseph Kolaizcek, a petty criminal in rural Kashubia (located in modern-day Poland). He hides underneath the skirts of a young woman named Anna Bronski. He has sex with her and she tries to hide her emotions, as the troops pass close by. She later gives birth to their daughter, who is Oskar's mother. Joseph evades the authorities for a year, but when they find him again, he jumps into a lake and is never seen again. Oskar speculates that either he drowned or escaped to America and became a millionaire.\\nIn 1927, on Oskar's third birthday, he is given a tin drum. Reflecting on the foolish antics of his drunken parents and friends, he resolves to stop growing and throws himself down the cellar stairs. From that day on, he does not grow at all. Oskar discovers that he can shatter glass with his voice, an ability he often uses whenever he is upset. Oskar's drumming also causes the members of a Nazi rally to start dancing. During a visit to the circus, Oskar befriends Bebra, a performing dwarf who chose to stop growing at age 10.\\nWhen Alfred, Agnes, Jan and Oskar are on an outing to the beach, they see an eel-picker collecting eels from a horse's head used as bait. The sight makes Agnes vomit repeatedly. Alfred buys some of the eels and prepares them for dinner that night. When he insists that Agnes eat them, she becomes distraught and retreats to the bedroom. Jan enters and comforts her, all within earshot of Oskar who is hiding in the closet. She calmly returns to the dinner table and eats the eels. Over the next few days, she binges on fish. Anna Bronski helps reveal that Agnes is worried her pregnancy is due to her relations with Jan. In anger, Agnes vows that the child will never be born. She dies shortly thereafter, seemingly from the accumulated stress.\\nAt the funeral, Oskar encounters Sigismund Markus, the kindly Jewish toy seller who supplies him with replacement drums, and who was also in love with Agnes. Markus is ordered by two of the mourners to leave because he is Jewish; Nazism is on the rise, and the Jewish and Polish residents of Danzig are under increasing pressure. Markus later commits suicide after his shop is vandalized and a synagogue is burned down by SA men.\\nOn 1 September 1939, Oskar and Jan go looking for Kobyella, who can repair his drum. Jan slips into the Polish Post Office, despite a Nazi cordon, and participates in an armed standoff against the Nazis. During the ensuing battle, Kobyella is fatally shot and Jan is wounded. They play Skat until Kobyella dies and the Germans capture the building. Oskar is taken home, while Jan is arrested and later executed.\\nAlfred hires sixteen-year-old Maria to work in his shop. Oskar seduces Maria, but later discovers Alfred having sex with her. Oskar bursts into the room, makes Alfred ejaculate inside her (when he was expected to pull out, to avoid getting her pregnant), causing Maria to become angry at Alfred when he blames Oskar for the inadvertent insemination.\\nWhile rinsing her vagina in an attempt to remove the deposited semen, she and Oskar fight, and he hits her in the groin. She later gives birth to a son, who Oskar is convinced is his. Oskar also has a brief sexual relationship with Lina Greff, the wife of the local grocer and scoutmaster. It is implied that Lina was sexually frustrated as her husband preferred to spend more time with the Hitler Youth boys. Lina's husband later commits suicide (or is executed) after an official from the Nazi regime catches him 'playing' with those boys.\\nDuring World War II, Oskar meets Bebra and Roswitha, another dwarf performer in Bebra's successful troupe. Oskar decides to join them, using his glass-shattering voice as part of the act. Oskar and Roswitha have an affair, but she is killed by artillery fire during the Allied invasion of Normandy while on tour.\\nOskar returns home. Much of the city has been destroyed and the Russians are fast approaching. Oskar gives Maria's three-year-old son Kurt a tin drum like his own. The Russians break into the cellar where the family is hiding. Some of them gang-rape Lina. Alfred is killed by a soldier after swallowing and choking violently on his Nazi party pin. Later Matzerath's shop goes to Mariusz Fajngold, a Jewish survivor of Treblinka who also takes care of Alfred's funeral.\\nDuring Alfred's burial, Oskar decides to grow up, and throws his drum into the grave. As he does, Kurt throws a stone at his head and he falls into the grave. Afterward, an attendee announces Oskar is growing again, though he remains severely injured. The family, apart from Anna Bronski, leave for the West.\\n\"},\n",

       "  'Description': 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (German: Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari) is a 1920 German silent horror film, directed by Robert Wiene and written by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer. Considered the quintessential work of German Expressionist cinema, it tells the story of an insane hypnotist (Werner Krauss) who uses a somnambulist (Conrad Veidt) to commit murders. The film features a dark and twisted visual style, with sharp-pointed forms, oblique and curving lines, structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets.\\nThe script was inspired by various experiences from the lives of Janowitz and Mayer, both pacifists who were left distrustful of authority after their experiences with the military during World War I. The film makes use of a frame story, with a prologue and epilogue combined with a twist ending. Janowitz has said this device was forced upon the writers against their will. The film\\'s design was handled by Hermann Warm, Walter Reimann and Walter Röhrig, who recommended a fantastic, graphic style over a naturalistic one.\\nThe film thematizes brutal and irrational authority. Writers and scholars have argued the film reflects a subconscious need in German society for a tyrant, and is an example of Germany\\'s obedience to authority and unwillingness to rebel against deranged authority. Some critics have interpreted Caligari as representing the German war government, with Cesare symbolic of the common man conditioned, like soldiers, to kill.  Other themes of the film include the destabilized contrast between insanity and sanity, the subjective perception of reality, and the duality of human nature.\\nThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was released just as foreign film industries were easing restrictions on the import of German films following World War I, so it was screened internationally. Accounts differ as to its financial and critical success upon release, but modern film critics and historians have largely praised it as a revolutionary film. The film was voted number 12 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo. Critic Roger Ebert called it arguably \"the first true horror film\",[3] and film reviewer Danny Peary called it cinema\\'s first cult film and a precursor for arthouse films. Considered a classic, it helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema and had a major influence on American films, particularly in the genres of horror and film noir.\\n\\nPlot: In what appears to be a park, Francis sits on a bench with an older man and complains that spirits have driven him away from his family and home. When a dazed woman passes them, Francis explains she is his \"fiancée\" Jane and that they have suffered a great ordeal. Most of the rest of the film is a flashback of Francis\\' story, which takes place in Holstenwall, a shadowy village of twisted buildings and spiraling streets. \\nFrancis and his friend Alan, who are good-naturedly competing for Jane\\'s affections, plan to visit the town fair. Meanwhile, a mysterious man named Dr. Caligari seeks a permit from the rude town clerk to present a spectacle at the fair, which features Cesare, a somnambulist. The clerk mocks and berates Caligari, but ultimately approves the permit. That night, the clerk is stabbed to death in his bed.\\nThe next morning, Francis and Alan visit Caligari\\'s sideshow attraction, where he opens a coffin-like box to reveal the sleeping Cesare. On Caligari\\'s order, Cesare awakens and answers questions from the audience. Despite Francis\\' protests, Alan asks, \"How long shall I live?\" To Alan\\'s horror, Cesare answers, \"The time is short. You die at dawn!\" Later that night, a figure breaks into Alan\\'s home and stabs him to death in his bed. A grief-stricken Francis investigates Alan\\'s murder with help from Jane and her father, Dr. Olsen, who obtains police authorization to investigate the somnambulist. That night, the police apprehend a criminal in possession of a knife who is caught attempting to murder an elderly woman. When questioned by Francis and Dr. Olsen, the criminal confesses he tried to kill the elderly woman, but denies any part in the two previous deaths; he was merely taking advantage of the situation to divert blame away from himself.\\nAt night, Francis spies on Caligari and observes what appears to be Cesare sleeping in his box. However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane\\'s home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, dragging her through the window onto the street. Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies. Francis confirms that the criminal who confessed to the elderly woman\\'s murder is still locked away and could not have been Jane\\'s attacker. Francis and the police investigate Caligari\\'s sideshow and discover that the \"Cesare\" sleeping in the box is only a dummy. Caligari escapes in the confusion. Francis follows him and sees Caligari go into an insane asylum.\\nUpon further investigation, Francis is shocked to learn that Caligari is the asylum\\'s director. With help from the asylum staff, Francis studies the director\\'s records and diary while the director is sleeping. The writings reveal his obsession with the story of an 18th-century mystic named Caligari, who used a somnambulist named Cesare to commit murders in northern Italian towns. The director, attempting to understand the earlier Caligari, experiments on a somnambulist admitted to the asylum, who becomes his Cesare. The asylum director screams, \"I must become Caligari!\" Francis and the doctors call the police to Caligari\\'s office, where they show him Cesare\\'s corpse. Caligari then attacks one of the staff. He is subdued, restrained in a straitjacket, and becomes an inmate in his own asylum.\\nThe narrative returns to the present, where Francis concludes his story. In a twist ending, Francis is depicted as an asylum inmate. Jane and Cesare are patients as well; Jane believes that she is a queen, while Cesare is not a somnambulist but awake, quiet, and not visibly dangerous. The man Francis refers to as \"Dr. Caligari\" is the asylum director. Francis attacks him and is restrained in a straitjacket, then placed in the same cell where Caligari was confined in Francis\\'s story. The asylum director announces that, now that he understands Francis\\'s delusion, he is confident that he can cure him.\\n'},\n",

In the film, set in 1938, Indiana searches for his father, a Holy Grail scholar, who has been kidnapped and held hostage by the Nazis while on a journey to find the Holy Grail.\\nAfter some of the criticism that Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) received, Spielberg chose to make a more lighthearted film for the next installment, as well as bringing back several elements from Raiders of the Lost Ark. During the five years between The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade, he and executive producer Lucas reviewed several scripts before accepting Jeffrey Boam's. Filming locations included Spain, Italy, West Germany, Jordan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[2]\\nThe Last Crusade was released in the United States on May 24, 1989, by Paramount Pictures.

Years later in 1938, Jones again confronts the employer off the Portuguese coast, recovering the crucifix and escaping. \\nAfter returning to the United States, Jones learns that his father Henry has disappeared while searching for the Holy Grail. Walter Donovan, his father's financial backer, tasks Jones with finding both Henry and the Grail. Jones receives a package containing Henry's diary, which includes his research on the Grail, and travels to Venice alongside Marcus Brody to meet Henry's associate Elsa Schneider. Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Jones and Schneider discover a catacomb containing an inscribed shield which reveals that the path to the Grail begins in İskenderun. The two are subsequently attacked by a mysterious group who reveal themselves to be the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, dedicated to protecting the Grail. Jones spares the group's leader, Kazim, who informs him that Henry is being held at a castle in Austria. Jones entrusts Marcus with a map from the diary detailing a route to the Grail and sends him to İskenderun to rendezvous with their old friend Sallah. Discovering their rooms have been ransacked, Jones reveals the diary's existence to Schneider before they sleep together.\\nIn Austria, Jones and Schneider infiltrate the castle, discovering it to be under Nazi control. Jones finds Henry and tries to escape, but surrenders after Schneider is taken captive by the Nazis.

       "  'Description': 'Batman is a 1989 superhero film based on the DC Comics character of the same name, created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. Directed by Tim Burton, it is the first installment of Warner Bros.\\' initial Batman film series. The film was produced by Jon Peters and Peter Guber and stars Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton, Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, Michael Gough, and Jack Palance. The film takes place early in the title character\\'s war on crime and depicts his conflict with his archenemy The Joker.\\nAfter Burton was hired as director in 1986, Steve Englehart and Julie Hickson wrote film treatments before Sam Hamm wrote the first screenplay. Batman was not greenlit until after the success of Burton\\'s Beetlejuice (1988). The tone and themes of the film were partly influenced by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland\\'s The Killing Joke and Frank Miller\\'s The Dark Knight Returns. The film primarily adapts and diverts from the \"Red Hood\" origin story for the Joker, having Batman inadvertently cause gangster Jack Napier to fall into Axis Chemical acid, triggering his transformation into the psychotic Joker. Additionally, Batman creator Bob Kane worked as a consultant for the film.\\nNumerous leading men were considered for the role of Batman before Keaton was cast. Keaton\\'s casting was controversial since, by 1988, he had become typecast as a comedic actor and many observers doubted he could portray a serious role.[7] Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker under strict conditions that dictated top billing, a portion of the film\\'s earnings (including associated merchandise), and his own shooting schedule.\\nFilming took place at Pinewood Studios from October 1988 to January 1989. The budget escalated from $30\\xa0million to $48\\xa0million, while the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike forced Hamm to drop out. Warren Skaaren did rewrites, with additional uncredited drafts done by Charles McKeown and Jonathan Gems.\\nBatman was both critically and financially successful, earning over $400\\xa0million in box office totals. Critics and audiences particularly praised Nicholson and Keaton\\'s performances, Burton\\'s direction, the production design, and Elfman\\'s score. It was the fifth-highest-grossing film in history at the time of its release. The film received several Saturn Award nominations and a Golden Globe nomination for Nicholson\\'s performance, and won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction. It also led to the development of the equally successful Batman: The Animated Series (1992–1995), which in turn began the DC Animated Universe of spin-off media, and has influenced Hollywood\\'s modern marketing and development techniques of the superhero film genre. The film was followed by three sequels: Batman Returns (1992), with both Burton and Keaton returning; Batman Forever (1995), which featured Val Kilmer in the lead role; and Batman & Robin (1997), which featured George Clooney in the role.\\n\\nPlot: Reporter Alexander Knox and photojournalist Vicki Vale investigate sightings of the \"Batman\", a masked vigilante targeting Gotham City\\'s criminals. Both attend a fundraiser hosted by billionaire Bruce Wayne, who is secretly Batman, having chosen this path after witnessing a mugger murder his parents when he was a child. During the event, Wayne becomes infatuated with Vale.\\nMeanwhile, mob boss Carl Grissom sends his sociopathic second-in-command Jack Napier to raid Axis Chemicals and retrieve incriminating evidence. However, this is secretly a ploy to have Napier murdered for sleeping with Grissom\\'s mistress Alicia Hunt. Corrupt lieutenant Max Eckhardt arranges the hit on Napier by conducting an unauthorized police operation. However, Commissioner James Gordon arrives, takes command, and orders the officers to capture Napier alive. Batman also appears, while Napier kills Eckhardt as revenge for the double-crossing. During a scuffle with Batman, Napier topples off a catwalk and falls into a vat of chemicals. Although presumed dead, Napier survives with various disfigurements including chalk white skin and emerald green hair and nails. He undergoes surgery to repair the damage, but ends up with a rictus grin. Driven insane by his new appearance, Napier, now calling himself \"the Joker\", kills Grissom, massacres Grissom\\'s associates, and takes over his operations.\\nHe then starts terrorizing Gotham by lacing hygiene products with \"Smylex\" – a deadly chemical that causes victims to die laughing. The Joker soon becomes obsessed with Vicki and lures her to the Gotham Museum of Art, which his henchmen start vandalizing. Batman rescues Vicki, takes her to the Batcave, and provides her with all of his research on Smylex, which will allow Gotham\\'s residents to escape the toxin. Conflicted with his love for her, Wayne visits her apartment intending to reveal his secret identity, only for the Joker to interrupt the meeting. Joker asks Wayne, \"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?\", which Wayne recognizes as the catchphrase used by the mugger who killed his parents, realizing the killer to have been Joker (as Napier) all along. He shoots Wayne, who survives thanks to a serving tray hidden underneath his shirt.\\nVicki is taken to the Batcave by Wayne\\'s butler, Alfred Pennyworth, who had been coaxing the relationship between the pair. After exposing his secret to Vicki, Wayne reveals he cannot focus on their relationship with the Joker on the loose. He then departs to destroy the Axis plant used to create Smylex. Meanwhile, the Joker lures Gotham\\'s citizens to a parade honoring Gotham\\'s bicentennial with the promise of free money. This turns out to be a trap designed to dose them with Smylex gas held within giant parade balloons. Batman foils his plan by using his Batwing to remove the balloons, but Joker shoots him down. The Batwing crashes in front of a cathedral, which Joker uses to take Vicki hostage. Batman pursues the Joker, and in the ensuing fight, he explains that Napier killed his parents and thus, indirectly created Batman. This leads Joker to realize Batman is Bruce Wayne. Joker eventually pulls Batman and Vicki over the cathedral\\'s roof, leaving them hanging while he calls in a helicopter. The helicopter is piloted by his goons, who throw down a ladder for him to climb. Batman uses a grappling hook to attach Joker\\'s leg to a crumbling gargoyle that eventually falls off the roof. Unable to bear the statue\\'s immense weight, Joker falls to his death while Batman and Vicki make it to safety.\\nSometime later, Gordon announces that the police have arrested all of Joker\\'s men, effectively dismantled of what remained of Carl Grissom\\'s mafia organizations, and unveils the Bat-Signal. Batman leaves the police a note, promising to defend Gotham should crime strike again, and asking them to use the Bat-Signal to summon him in times of need. Alfred takes Vicki to Wayne Manor, explaining that Wayne will be a little late. She responds that she is not surprised, as Batman looks at the signal\\'s projection from a rooftop, standing watch over the city.\\n'},\n",

Set in the Old West and Antebellum South, it is a highly stylized, heavily revisionist tribute to Spaghetti Westerns, in particular the 1966 Italian film Django by Sergio Corbucci (the star of which, Franco Nero, has a cameo appearance). The story follows a black slave who trains under a German bounty hunter with the ultimate goal of reuniting with his long-lost wife.\\nDevelopment of Django Unchained began in 2007 when Tarantino was writing a book on Corbucci. By April 2011, Tarantino sent his final draft of the script to The Weinstein Company. Casting began in the summer of 2011, with Michael K. Williams and Will Smith being considered for the role of the title character before Foxx was cast. Principal photography took place from November 2011 to March 2012 in California, Wyoming, and Louisiana.\\nThe premiere of Django Unchained took place at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 11, 2012, and was theatrically released on December 25, 2012, in the United States, grossing over $426 million worldwide against its $100 million budget, becoming Tarantino\\'s highest grossing movie to date. The film received acclaim from critics, mainly for Waltz\\'s performance and Tarantino\\'s direction and screenplay, though the film\\'s usage of the word \"nigger\" and the film\\'s graphic violence drew controversy. The film received numerous awards and nominations, winning two out of five nominations at the 85th Academy Awards. Waltz won several awards for his performance, among them Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, Golden Globes and BAFTAs. For his screenplay, Tarantino won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and a BAFTA.\\n\\nPlot: In 1858 Texas, brothers Ace and Dicky Speck drive a group of shackled black slaves on foot. Among them is Django, sold off and separated from his wife Broomhilda von Shaft, a house slave who speaks German and English. They are stopped by Dr. King Schultz, a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter seeking to buy Django for his knowledge of the three outlaw Brittle brothers, overseers at the plantation of Django\\'s previous owner and for whom Schultz has a warrant. When Ace refuses to sell Django to Schultz and cocks his gun, Schultz kills him and shoots Dicky\\'s horse in order to pin him to the ground; he advises the freed slaves to take the opportunity for revenge. Schultz offers Django his freedom and $75 in exchange for help tracking down the Brittles.\\nDjango and Schultz kill the Brittle brothers at Spencer \"Big Daddy\" Bennett\\'s Tennessee plantation. In turn, Bennett pursues them with an armed posse. Schultz ambushes the posse with explosives and Django kills Bennett. Feeling responsible for Django, Schultz agrees to help him find and rescue Broomhilda. They return to Texas where Django collects his first bounty, keeping the handbill as a memento and for good luck. He and Schultz rack up several bounties before spring when they travel to Mississippi and learn that Broomhilda\\'s new owner is a member of the American gentry Calvin J. Candie, the charming but cruel owner of the \"Candyland\" plantation, where male slaves are forced to wrestle to the death in brutal \"Mandingo\" fights. \\nSchultz and Django hatch a plan: deciding that Candie will refuse to sell Broomhilda if they try to buy her upfront, they will instead offer $12,000 (equivalent to $406,000 in 2022) for one of his best fighters as a pretext to acquiring Broomhilda for a nominal sum. They meet Candie at his gentlemen\\'s club and make the offer. Intrigued, Candie invites them to Candyland. En route, the group encounters Candie\\'s slave trackers who have cornered D\\'Artagnan, an escapee Mandingo fighter. Django is forced to intervene when Schultz foolishly attempts to buy D\\'Artagnan on the spot to save him. Candie has the trackers\\' guard dogs maul D\\'Artagnan to death, visibly upsetting Schultz. \\nHaving told Broomhilda of their plan, Schultz offers to buy her as his escort while negotiating the initial Mandingo deal during dinner. Candie\\'s staunchly loyal and suspicious head house slave Stephen realizes that Broomhilda knows Django, deduces their plan, and alerts Candie. Enraged, Candie alters the deal at gunpoint to sell Broomhilda for $12,000 instead of the fighter; Schultz reluctantly agrees. During the sale\\'s finalization, Candie threatens to kill Broomhilda if Schultz does not shake his hand to seal the deal. Having had enough of Candie\\'s arrogance, Schultz impulsively shoots and kills Candie. Butch Pooch, Candie\\'s bodyguard, kills Schultz, and Django kills Pooch, Candie\\'s lawyer Leonide Moguy, and several of Candie\\'s henchmen in a prolonged gunfight, but is forced to surrender when Broomhilda is taken hostage.\\nThe next morning, the chained Django is tortured and about to be castrated by overseer Billy Crash when Stephen arrives, informing him that Candie\\'s sister Lara, who has taken charge of the plantation, has ordered him to be sold to a mining company and worked to death. En route there along with other slaves, Django devises an escape plan and uses his first handbill to prove to his escorts that he is a bounty hunter. He falsely says the men on the handbill, from his first bounty, are at Candyland and promises the escorts a share of the reward money. Once released, Django immediately kills his escorts, retrieves his clothes and weapons, and returns to Candyland with dynamite. \\nRecovering Broomhilda\\'s freedom papers from Schultz\\'s corpse, Django bids his deceased mentor goodbye and avenges him and D\\'Artagnan by killing the trackers. He then frees Broomhilda just as Candie\\'s mourners return from his burial. At the mansion, Django kills Lara, Crash, and the remaining henchmen, releases the two remaining house slaves, and kneecaps Stephen before igniting the dynamite he had planted throughout the mansion. Django and Broomhilda watch from a distance as the mansion explodes before riding off together.\\n'},\n",

Ting'en remains silent and seeks comfort in a brothel, where he becomes romantically involved with a prostitute.\\nMeanwhile, Akutagawa confronts General Fujita of the Imperial Japanese Army after suspecting that his match against Huo had been rigged, which he considers dishonorable. After a heated argument, Fujita kills Akutagawa by breaking his back in front of the Japanese ambassador, and then places the blame on Chen. Enraged by their master's death, Akutagawa's students attack the Jingwu School, culminating in a fight that is eventually stopped by the local police. Chen is arrested and placed on trial for allegedly murdering Akutagawa. Several bribed witnesses provide false and conflicting accounts of the murder, but the court refuses to accept testimony from any Chinese defense witnesses on the grounds of bias towards Chen. Mitsuko shows up and testifies that Chen is innocent because he spent the night with her, and the court accepts her false testimony because she is Japanese. Chen is exonerated, but his apparent relationship with Mitsuko ruins his reputation because the Chinese view it as an act of betrayal against his fellow Chinese. Ting'en and the senior Jingwu members demand that Chen leaves either Mitsuko or the school. Huo uses the opportunity to settle his personal vendetta against Chen by challenging him to a fight. Although Chen defeats Ting'en, he still chooses to leave with Mitsuko. Huo feels humiliated by his defeat so he gives up his position as master of Jingwu before leaving to join his lover. Jingwu's members eventually discover Huo's relationship with her and reprimand him. Huo learns his lesson and returns to Jingwu.\\nChen and Mitsuko face hostility from the locals and are forced to take shelter in an abandoned hut near Huo Yuanjia's grave. At the same time, Funakoshi arrives from Japan, as requested by Fujita, to eliminate Chen. Funakoshi engages Chen in a fight, which ends in a draw and the conclusion that if Chen learns to adapt to his opponent's moves, he will be unbeatable. Funakoshi leaves after warning Chen about Fujita's ill intentions and brutal methods. Days later, Huo Ting'en visits Chen and apologizes for his earlier behavior, saying that Jingwu School accepts Chen and Mitsuko's relationship now. Huo teaches Chen the Mizong Fist that night while Mitsuko leaves secretly, leaving behind a message for Chen that she will wait for him in Japan.\\nThe next day, Chen and Huo confront Fujita at his dojo, where Fujita exposes a traitor from Jingwu who played a role in Huo Yuanjia's death, and shoots him. Huo Ting'en then fights Fujita, who appears to be incredibly strong and resilient, and Huo suffers grave injuries. Chen engages Fujita in a long and exhausting fight, and eventually defeats him. Just as Chen and Huo are about to leave, the enraged Fujita comes after them with a katana. Huo pushes Chen out of the katana's way but is stabbed in the arm, and Chen is forced to kill Fujita. Japanese soldiers surround them and prepare to open fire. The Japanese ambassador, who is a pacifist against rising militarism in his country, arrives and orders his soldiers to stand down. He agrees with Chen's actions as he has been aware that Fujita is a madman, but also warns them that the Japanese government will use Fujita's death as an excuse to start a war with China, unless the Chinese can account for Fujita's death by executing the murderer. Chen expresses his willingness to accept the blame for Fujita's death in order to prevent war, earning the ambassador's further admiration. Instead of ordering Chen's death, the ambassador stages a fake execution and substitutes the dead Jingwu's traitor's body for Chen's. Meanwhile, Chen secretly leaves Shanghai for Manchuria.\\n\"},\n",

       "  'Description': 'Rififi (French: Du rififi chez les hommes[a]) is a 1955 French crime film adaptation of Auguste Le Breton\\'s novel of the same name. Directed by American blacklisted filmmaker Jules Dassin, the film stars Jean Servais as the aging gangster Tony \"le Stéphanois\", Carl Möhner as Jo \"le Suédois\", Robert Manuel as Mario Farrati, and Jules Dassin as César \"le Milanais\". The foursome band together to commit an almost impossible theft, the burglary of an exclusive jewelry shop in the Rue de la Paix. The centerpiece of the film is an intricate half-hour heist scene depicting the crime in detail, shot in near silence, without dialogue or music. The fictional burglary has been mimicked by criminals in actual crimes around the world.[5][6]\\nAfter he was blacklisted from Hollywood, Dassin found work in France where he was asked to direct Rififi. Despite his distaste for parts of the original novel, Dassin agreed to direct the film. He shot Rififi while working with a low budget, without a star cast, and with the production staff working for low wages.[2]\\nUpon the initial release of the film, it received positive reactions from audiences and critics in France, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The film earned Dassin the award for Best Director at the 1955 Cannes Film Festival.[7] Rififi was nominated by the National Board of Review for Best Foreign Film. Rififi was re-released theatrically in both 2000 and 2015[8] and is still highly acclaimed by modern film critics as one of the greatest works in French film noir.[9]\\n\\nPlot: Tony \"le Stéphanois\", a criminal who has served a five-year prison term for a jewel heist, is out on the street and down on his luck. His friend Jo approaches him about a smash-and-grab proposed by mutual friend Mario in which the trio would cut the glass on a Parisian jeweler\\'s front window in broad daylight and snatch some gems. Tony declines. He then learns that his old girlfriend, Mado, took up in his absence with gangster Parisian nightclub owner Pierre Grutter. Finding Mado working at Grutter\\'s, Tony invites her back to his rundown flat. She is obviously well-kept, and Tony savagely beats her for being so deeply involved with Grutter. Tony changes his mind about the heist; he now accepts on the condition that rather than merely robbing the window, they will take on the more difficult but more lucrative task of robbing the store\\'s safe. Mario suggests they employ the services of Italian compatriot César, a safecracker. The four devise and rehearse an ingenious plan to break into the store and disable its sophisticated alarm system.\\nThe caper begins with the group chiseling through a cement ceiling from an upstairs flat on a Sunday night. The suspenseful break-in is completed, and the criminals appear to escape without leaving any trace of their identities. However, without the others\\' knowledge, César pocketed a diamond ring as a bauble for his lover Viviane, a chanteuse at Grutter\\'s club. The heist makes headline news and the four men arrange to fence the loot with a London contact. Meanwhile, Grutter has seen Mado and her injuries, and she breaks off their relationship. Infuriated at Tony\\'s interference in his life, Grutter gives heroin to his drug-addicted brother Rémy and tells him to murder Tony. But then, the other Grutter brother, Louis, shows them the diamond César gave to Viviane and they realize that César, Mario, and Tony were responsible for the jewel theft. Grutter forces César to confess. Forsaking a FF10 million police reward, Grutter decides to steal the jewels from Tony\\'s gang, with Rémy brutally murdering Mario and his wife Ida when they refuse to reveal where the loot is hidden. Tony retrieves it from the couple\\'s apartment and anonymously pays for a splendid funeral for them. He then goes looking for Grutter and stumbles onto the captive César, who confesses having squealed. Citing \"the rules,\" Tony ruefully kills him.\\nMeanwhile, seeking to force their adversaries\\' hand, Grutter\\'s thugs kidnap Jo\\'s five-year-old son Tonio and hold him for ransom. The London fence arrives with the payoff, after which Tony leaves to single-handedly rescue the child by force, advising Jo it is the only way they will see him alive.  With Mado\\'s help, he tracks Tonio down at Grutter\\'s country house and kills Rémy and Louis while rescuing him. On the way back to Paris, Tony learns Jo has cracked under the pressure and agreed to meet Grutter at his house with the money. When Jo arrives Grutter tells him Tony has already snatched the child and kills him. Seconds too late to save his friend, Tony is mortally wounded by Grutter but kills him as Grutter tries to flee with the loot. Bleeding profusely, Tony drives maniacally back to Paris and delivers Tonio home safely before dying at the wheel as police and bystanders close in on him and a suitcase filled with FF120 million in cash. Jo\\'s wife, Louise, takes her child from the car and leaves the suitcase and the body to police.\\n'},\n",

Smaug destroyed the nearby town of Dale, drove the Dwarves out of their mountain and took their hoard of gold. Thrór\\'s grandson, Thorin, sees King Thranduil and his Wood-elves on a nearby hillside, and is dismayed when they leave rather than aid his people, resulting in Thorin\\'s everlasting hatred of Elves.\\nIn the Shire, 50-year-old Bilbo is tricked by the wizard Gandalf the Grey into hosting a dinner for Thorin and his company of Dwarves: Balin, Dwalin, Fíli, Kíli, Dori, Nori, Ori, Óin, Glóin, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur. Gandalf\\'s aim is to recruit Bilbo as the company\\'s \"burglar\" to aid them in their quest to enter the Lonely Mountain. Bilbo is unwilling to accept at first, but has a change of heart after the company leaves without him the next day, racing to join them. Travelling onward, the company is captured by three Trolls. Bilbo stalls the Trolls from eating them until dawn, and Gandalf exposes the trolls to sunlight, turning them to stone. The company locates the Trolls\\' cave and finds treasure and Elven blades.

When Bruce\\'s coveted job is taken by his rival, Evan Baxter, a vulgar on-camera outburst leads to his dismissal from the station. After a series of misfortunes, Bruce complains to God that \"He\\'s the one that should be fired\".  Bruce receives a message on his pager, which takes him to an empty warehouse where he meets God. God offers to give Bruce his powers for a week, under two conditions—Bruce cannot tell others he\\'s God (in order to avoid the media attention), nor can he use the powers to alter free will.\\nBruce at first uses his powers for personal gains, such as getting his job back, exacting revenge on a street gang that bullied him earlier, and impressing his girlfriend, Grace Connelly. He also causes miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa\\'s body during a segment on police training, or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him the nickname \"Mr. Exclusive\". Bruce also causes Evan to embarrass himself on-air, consequently getting Evan fired, and Bruce becomes the new anchor. Bruce, however, also starts hearing voices in his head and re-encounters God, who explains the voices are prayers that Bruce must deal with. Bruce creates a computerized email-like system to handle the prayers but finds that the influx is far too many for him to handle, and thus sets the program to answer every prayer \\'Yes\\' automatically.\\nDuring a party celebrating Bruce\\'s promotion, Grace finds Bruce kissing his co-anchor Susan Ortega (who forcefully comes on to him) and quickly leaves. Bruce tries following her and then using his powers to convince her to stay but cannot influence her free will. Bruce later discovers that Buffalo has fallen into chaos due to his actions: parts of the city believe the Apocalypse is nearly upon Earth due to the meteor strikes, while a large number of people, all having prayed to win the multi-million dollar lottery and received only seventeen dollars in return, have started rioting in the streets. Bruce returns to God, learning he cannot solve all the problems and so must figure a way out on his own. Bruce thus starts helping others without divine powers, including giving Evan his job back. As he returns to his computer at home and goes about answering prayers, he finds one from Grace, wishing for his success and well-being. Another prayer from Grace immediately arrives, this one wishing not to be in love with him anymore, to avoid further pain.\\nFinally realizing his selfishness, Bruce walks alone on a highway, asking God to take back his powers and leaving his fate in his hands. Bruce is suddenly hit by a truck and meets God in the afterlife. When he asks Bruce what he really wants, Bruce admits that he only wants to make sure Grace finds a man that would make her happy. God agrees, and Bruce is resurrected and taken to the hospital, where his doctors help him recover. Grace finally arrives at the hospital and rekindles her relationship with Bruce. Following his recovery, Bruce returns to his field reporting, but decides to take more pleasure in the simple stories.\\n'},\n",

The land has great monetary value, but is also a family legacy. While Matt (like his father before) has ably managed his own finances, most of his cousins have squandered their inheritances. With the trust expiring in seven years due to the rule against perpetuities, the King clan is pressuring Matt to sell the land for hundreds of millions of dollars. Amidst these discussions, a boating accident has rendered Matt\\'s wife, Elizabeth, comatose. With Elizabeth hospitalized, Matt is forced to cope with his two troubled daughters, 10-year-old Scottie, who seeks attention by bullying other children, and 17-year-old Alex with a history of substance abuse who is away at a private boarding school on the Big Island. Doctors determine that Elizabeth\\'s coma is irreversible and her living will directs all life support to be discontinued. When Matt tells Alex, she reveals she learned Elizabeth was having an affair during her last visit, causing a major rift between mother and daughter.\\nTwo close family friends, Kai and Mark Mitchell, tell Matt that Elizabeth was unhappy and loved Brian Speer, a real estate agent, and wanted a divorce. After Matt informs friends about Elizabeth\\'s condition so they can say goodbye, he decides Brian should also have an opportunity to do the same. He and the girls, along with Alex\\'s slacker friend Sid, travel to Kauai to find Brian. While there, Matt\\'s cousin, Hugh, mentions that Brian is brother-in-law to Don Hollitzer, the developer to whom the majority of the family wants to sell the land. Brian stands to make a small fortune from the sales commission. Matt privately confronts Brian and informs him Elizabeth is dying, and offers him an opportunity to say goodbye. Brian says Elizabeth loved him, but he only loves his wife and children, then apologizes to Matt.\\nFrustrated and fragile from recent events, Matt asks the doctor to explain Elizabeth\\'s inevitable death to Scottie. Elizabeth\\'s father, Scott, admonishes Matt for failing to be a more generous and loving husband. Withholding his wife\\'s affair, Matt agrees with him, but Sid and Alex unexpectedly defend Matt. At the King family meeting, Matt overrules the majority vote of his cousins, deciding instead to keep the land and look for a way around the rule against perpetuities. Shocked, Hugh tells Matt that the family will take legal action, but Matt is undeterred.\\nAfter learning about Brian\\'s affair with Elizabeth, his wife, Julie, comes to the hospital. She tearfully tells a comatose Elizabeth that she wants to hate her for \"trying to destroy\" her family, but that she forgives her. Matt comes to terms with his wife\\'s infidelity and impending death. He kisses her goodbye, followed by Alex and Scottie. They scatter Elizabeth\\'s ashes in the ocean off Waikiki.\\nLater, Matt, Scottie and Alex eat ice cream together as they watch March of the Penguins, covering themselves in a blanket that Elizabeth had at the hospital.\\n'},\n",

Set in a post-apocalyptic future devastated by an unknown disease, a convict (Willis) is sent back in time to investigate its origin.\\nAfter Universal Studios acquired the rights to remake La Jetée as a full-length film, David and Janet Peoples were hired to write the script. Under Gilliam\\'s direction, Universal granted the filmmakers a $29.5 million budget, and filming lasted from February to May 1995. The film was shot mostly in Philadelphia and Baltimore, the settings of the events in the story.\\nThe film was released to critical praise and grossed $168.8 million worldwide. Pitt was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and he won a Golden Globe Award for his performance. The film also won and was nominated for various categories at the Saturn Awards.\\n\\nPlot: A deadly virus, released in 1996, wipes out almost all of humanity, forcing survivors to live underground. A group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to have released the virus.\\nIn 2035, James Cole is a prisoner living in an underground compound beneath Philadelphia. Cole is selected to be sent back in time to find the original virus to help scientists develop a cure in exchange for a reduced sentence. Meanwhile, Cole is troubled by dreams involving a foot chase and shooting at an airport.\\nCole arrives in Baltimore, in 1990, not 1996 as planned; he is arrested and incarcerated at a mental hospital on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly. There he encounters Jeffrey Goines, a mental patient with environmentalist and anti-corporatist views. Cole is interviewed by a panel of doctors where he tries to explain that the virus outbreak has already happened.\\nAfter an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell, but he disappears, waking up back in 2035. Cole is interrogated by the scientists who play a distorted voicemail message that asserts the association of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole another chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. Cole accidentally arrives at a battlefield during World War I, where he sees one of his compatriots named Jose also sent back. Wounded, Jose claims he found a spider that carries antibodies and entrusts him with it. Cole is shot in the leg, then gets transported to 1996.\\nIn 1996, Railly gives a lecture about the Cassandra complex to a group of scientists. At the post-lecture book signing, Railly meets Dr. Peters who tells her that apocalypse alarmists represent the sane vision while humanity\\'s gradual destruction of the environment is the real lunacy.\\nCole arrives at the venue after seeing flyers publicizing it and, when Railly departs, he kidnaps her and forces her to take him to Philadelphia. They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys before they set out in search of him. When Cole confronts Goines, he denies any involvement with the group and says that, in 1990, Cole originated the idea of wiping out humanity with a virus stolen from Goines\\' virologist father, Dr. Leland Goines.\\nCole is transported back to 2035 where he reaffirms to the scientists his commitment to his mission. But when he finds Railly again in 1996, he tells her he now believes himself crazy as she had suggested. Meanwhile, Railly has discovered evidence of his time travel which she shows him, believing he is sane. They decide to depart for the Florida Keys before the onset of the plague.\\nThey learn that the Army of the Twelve Monkeys was not the source of the epidemic; the group\\'s major act of protest is releasing animals from a zoo and placing Goines\\' father in an animal cage. At the airport, Cole leaves a message telling the scientists that following the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is the wrong track and he will not return. Cole is confronted by Jose, who gives Cole a handgun and instructs him to follow orders.\\nRailly spots Dr. Peters at the airport and recognizes him from a newspaper as an assistant of Goines\\' father. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that match the locations of the viral outbreaks.\\nCole forces his way through a security checkpoint in pursuit of Peters. After drawing his gun, Cole is shot by police. As Cole lies dying in Railly\\'s arms, Railly suddenly begins to scan the crowd around her. Railly finally makes eye contact with a small boy—the young James Cole witnessing the scene of his own death, which will replay in his dreams for years to come. Peters, aboard the plane with the virus, sits down next to Jones, one of the scientists from the future, who comments that her job is \"insurance\".

Sent to collect her father\\'s body, Mattie asks the local sheriff about the search for Chaney. He tells her that Chaney has likely fled with \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper and his gang into Indian Territory, where the sheriff has no authority, so she inquires about hiring a Deputy U.S. Marshal. The sheriff gives three recommendations, and Mattie chooses the \"meanest\" of the three, Rooster Cogburn. Cogburn initially rebuffs her offer, doubting both her grit and her wealth, but she raises the money by aggressive horse-trading.\\nTexas Ranger LaBoeuf arrives in town, pursuing Chaney for the murder of a Texas State Senator. LaBoeuf proposes joining Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father\\'s murder, not in Texas for killing the senator. Mattie insists on traveling with Cogburn but he departs without her, having gone with LaBoeuf to apprehend Chaney and split the reward.\\nAfter pursuing and catching up to the lawmen, Mattie is spanked for her perceived insolence by LaBoeuf until Cogburn draws his weapon on LaBoeuf. This, combined with a further disagreement, prompts Cogburn to end his arrangement with LaBoeuf; the latter leaves to pursue Chaney on his own. At a rural dugout, Cogburn and Mattie find two outlaws, Quincy and Moon, who surrender after Cogburn shoots and injures Moon. Initially, the outlaws deny any knowledge of Ned Pepper or Chaney, but Cogburn, using Moon\\'s worsening injury as leverage, convinces Moon to cooperate. Quincy, enraged, stabs Moon and is himself shot and killed by Cogburn. A dying Moon informs Cogburn that Pepper and his gang will arrive at the dugout later that night for supplies.\\nCogburn and Mattie plan an ambush for the Pepper gang, but LaBoeuf arrives first and is confronted by the gang. Cogburn shoots two gang members and accidentally hits LaBoeuf, but Pepper escapes. Due to his substantial injuries LaBoeuf rejoins Cogburn and Mattie. The next morning the three set off again in pursuit of Chaney and the Pepper gang, who Cogburn believes may be hiding out in the Winding Stair Mountains. Cogburn begins to drink heavily and the personal animosity between Cogburn and LaBoeuf resumes.  After several days of searching, the three find no trace of Chaney or the Pepper gang. Drunk, Cogburn declares that the trail has gone cold, quits the pursuit, and states that his business arrangement with Mattie is over. LaBoeuf leaves the posse, declaring he will return to Texas. Mattie expresses regret to LaBoeuf that she had hired the wrong man and they reconcile with both admitted they misjudged each other.\\nWhile retrieving water from a stream, Mattie happens upon Chaney. She shoots and wounds him, but her revolver then misfires, allowing Chaney to take her hostage. Ned Pepper convinces Cogburn to leave the area by threatening to kill Mattie. Pepper then departs with the rest of the gang, stating someone will return with a fresh horse for Chaney and instructing him to not harm her while they are alone waiting. Chaney, musing that Pepper has abandoned him to be captured by the law, attempts to kill Mattie. LaBoeuf arrives and knocks Chaney unconscious revealing that he and Cogburn had reunited shortly after the initial gunfight. He was to rescue Mattie while Cogburn intercepts the fleeing gang in a four-to-one standoff.\\nCogburn and the outlaws charge at each other headlong, with Cogburn killing two of the gang and induces a third to flee before his own horse is shot and falls, trapping him. As Pepper, alone and mortally wounded, prepares to execute Cogburn, LaBoeuf shoots Pepper from 400 yards with his Sharps rifle. Chaney regains consciousness and knocks out LaBoeuf, but Mattie seizes LaBoeuf\\'s rifle and shoots Chaney in the chest, killing him. The recoil knocks her into a pit, where she is bitten by a rattlesnake. Cogburn arrives and rescues Mattie, thanking LaBoeuf and promising to send help for him before hastily departing with Mattie to reach a doctor. After their horse collapses from exhaustion, Cogburn carries a delirious Mattie on foot to reach help. Although Cogburn stays with Mattie until she is out of danger, he is gone by the time she regains consciousness, and her arm is ultimately amputated.\\nTwenty-five years later, Mattie receives a letter from Cogburn inviting her to attend a traveling Wild West show in which he is performing. When she arrives at the show site, she learns that Cogburn died three days earlier.

He is unable to end his life by himself and does not wish to implicate his family or friends, as by Spanish law, they would be charged with murder or assisting a suicide. Following the death of his mother, he is cared for by his sister-in-law, Manuela. Ramón's elder brother José does not believe he should have the right to die; both Manuela and her son, Javier, believe in his case.\\nRamón's friend Gené, who works for an organisation fighting for the right to die, puts him in contact with Julia, a lawyer. As she seeks to learn more about him and his situation in order to fight for his cause, he recounts his past and his reasons for wanting to die: He says that there is no dignity in living paralysed. After seeing his story online, Rosa visits Ramón to convince him to live. He demands that she respect his wishes and she leaves, upset. Later, whilst DJing her part-time radio show, she apologises on air in the hopes that he is listening. She continues to visit, bringing her children, and the two strike up a friendship. Despite romantic interest in both women, Ramón maintains that he is spoken for by death.\\nJulia reads Ramón's memoir describing his life and experiences as a quadriplegic and urges him to publish it. He imagines flying from his bed to visit her on the beach. Later, she is hospitalised with a stroke and admitted to rehab to relearn how to walk. The two write letters to each other, sending updates of their lives. Ramón loses a court case for his right to die. Rosa, in tears, appears at his house and Ramón admits that he has planned a way to commit suicide without the direct and obvious involvement of anyone else.\\nMeanwhile, Padre Francisco, a quadriplegic Catholic priest, comes to convince Ramón to want to live. Ramón refuses to be carried downstairs and so the two men converse through the help of a church boy, who runs up and down to share their arguments. Angry and upset, Manuela asks him to leave. Julia visits to assist Ramón in writing his memoir whilst his family and friends discuss his right to die. Divided, they fight. But Ramón is unwavering in his wish. Again, he imagines that he is able-bodied, kissing Julia. Later, she admits that her condition will only become more severe and that she is planning to kill herself. But first, she would like to help Ramón.\\nRamón and Javier work together to design and build a wheelchair for him in which he can appear in court to fight for his own right to die. His appeal is ultimately rejected, but Ramón eventually fulfils his wish nonetheless. Each of his friends and family complete a small action in his death; not enough to convict any of them of his murder or assisting his suicide. He records himself on a video camera, narrating his own death, before ingesting a cyanide-laced drink that kills him.\\n\"},\n",

It was followed by Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004).\\n\\nPlot: Spending the summer with the Dursleys, Harry Potter meets Dobby, a house-elf who warns him that it is dangerous to return to Hogwarts. Dobby sabotages an important dinner for the Dursleys, who lock up Harry to prevent his return to Hogwarts. Harry\\'s friend Ron Weasley and his brothers Fred and George rescue him in their father\\'s flying car.\\nIn Diagon Alley, Harry, the Weasleys and Hermione Granger notice a book-signing by Gilderoy Lockhart, Hogwarts\\' new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. There, Harry sees Draco Malfoy\\'s father, Lucius, slip a book into Ginny Weasley\\'s cauldron. After being blocked from entering Platform Nine and Three-Quarters at King\\'s Cross railway station, Harry and Ron take the car to Hogwarts. There, they crash into the Whomping Willow, breaking Ron\\'s wand, and receive detention.\\nIn detention, Harry hears a strange voice and later finds caretaker Argus Filch\\'s cat, Mrs Norris, petrified beside a message written in blood: \"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, enemies of the heir... beware.\" One of Hogwarts\\' founders, Salazar Slytherin, supposedly constructed a secret Chamber containing a monster that only his heir can control, capable of purging the school of Muggle-born students. To solve this mystery, Harry, Ron, and Hermione plan to question Malfoy, using polyjuice potion, which they brew in a bathroom haunted by Moaning Myrtle, a ghost.\\nDuring a Quidditch game, Harry\\'s arm is broken by a rogue Bludger. Dobby visits him in the infirmary and reveals that he closed the barrier to  Platform Nine and Three-Quarters and made the Bludger chase Harry to force him to leave the school. He also reveals that the Chamber had been opened in the past. When Harry communicates with a snake, the school believes he is the heir. Disguised as two of Malfoy\\'s friends, Harry and Ron learn he is not the heir, but come to know that a Muggle-born girl died when the Chamber was last opened. Harry finds an enchanted diary owned by former student Tom Riddle, who opened the Chamber and blamed Rubeus Hagrid, leading to his expulsion. When the diary is stolen and Hermione is petrified, Harry and Ron question Hagrid. Professor Dumbledore, Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge, and Lucius arrive to take Hagrid to Azkaban, but he discreetly tells the boys to \"follow the spiders\". In the Forbidden Forest, Harry and Ron meet Hagrid\\'s giant pet spider, Aragog, who reveals Hagrid\\'s innocence.\\nA book page in Hermione\\'s hand identifies the monster as a basilisk, a giant serpent that kills people who make direct eye contact with it; the petrified victims only saw it indirectly. The school staff learns Ginny has been taken into the Chamber, and nominate Lockhart to save her. Harry and Ron find Lockhart preparing to flee, exposing him as a fraud. Deducing that Myrtle was the Muggle-born girl that the basilisk killed, they find the Chamber\\'s entrance in the bathroom she haunts. Once inside, Lockhart tries to stop Harry and Ron by using a memory charm. However, because he seized Ron\\'s broken wand, the spell backfires, erasing Lockhart\\'s memory and causing a cave-in that separates Harry from Ron and Lockhart.\\nHarry enters the Chamber alone and finds Ginny unconscious, guarded by Riddle. Riddle turns out to be Slytherin\\'s heir and Voldemort\\'s younger self. He used the diary to manipulate Ginny into reopening the Chamber. After Harry expresses his loyalty to Dumbledore, the latter\\'s pet phoenix Fawkes arrives with the Sorting Hat, causing Riddle to summon the basilisk. Fawkes blinds the basilisk, and the Sorting Hat produces the Sword of Gryffindor, with which Harry battles the basilisk. After a struggle, he kills it but is poisoned by one of its fangs.\\nDespite his injury, Harry stabs the diary with the basilisk fang, destroying Riddle and reviving Ginny. Fawkes\\' tears heal Harry, who returns to Hogwarts with his friends and a baffled Lockhart, earning Dumbledore\\'s praise and Hagrid\\'s release. Harry accuses Lucius, Dobby\\'s master, of planting the diary in Ginny\\'s cauldron, and tricks him into freeing Dobby.

       "  'Description': 'Die Hard is a 1988 American action film directed by John McTiernan and written by Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza, based on the 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp. It stars Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Alexander Godunov, and Bonnie Bedelia, with Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Paul Gleason, and Hart Bochner in supporting roles. Die Hard follows New York City police detective John McClane (Willis) who is caught up in a terrorist takeover of a Los Angeles skyscraper while visiting his estranged wife.\\nStuart was hired by 20th Century Fox to adapt Thorp\\'s novel in 1987. His draft was greenlit immediately by Fox, which was eager for a summer blockbuster the following year. The role of McClane was turned down by a host of the decade\\'s most popular actors, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. Known mainly for work on television, Willis was paid $5\\xa0million for his involvement, placing him among Hollywood\\'s highest-paid actors. The deal was seen as a poor investment by industry professionals and attracted significant controversy prior to its release. Filming took place between November 1987 and March 1988, on a $25\\xa0million–$35\\xa0million budget and almost entirely on location in and around Fox Plaza in Los Angeles.\\nExpectations for Die Hard were low; some marketing efforts omitted Willis\\'s image, ostensibly because the marketing team determined that the setting was as important as McClane. Upon its release in July 1988, initial reviews were mixed: criticism focused on its violence, plot, and Willis\\'s performance, while McTiernan\\'s direction and Rickman\\'s charismatic portrayal of the villain Hans Gruber were praised. Defying predictions, Die Hard grossed approximately $140\\xa0million, becoming the year\\'s tenth-highest-grossing film and the highest-grossing action film. Receiving four Academy Award nominations, it elevated Willis to leading-man status and made Rickman a celebrity.\\nDie Hard has been critically re-evaluated and is now considered one of the greatest action films. It is considered to have revitalized the action genre, largely due to its depiction of McClane as a vulnerable and fallible protagonist, in contrast to the muscle-bound and invincible heroes of other films of the period. Retrospective commentators also identified and analyzed its thematic concerns, including vengeance, masculinity, gender roles, and American anxieties over foreign influences. The film produced a host of imitators; the term \"Die Hard\\u2009\" became a shorthand for plots featuring overwhelming odds in a restricted environment, such as \"Die Hard on a bus\". It created a franchise comprising the sequels Die Hard 2 (1990), Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), Live Free or Die Hard (2007), and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013), plus video games, comics, and other merchandise. Deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress, Die Hard was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2017. Due to its Christmas Eve setting, Die Hard is also often named one of the best Christmas films, although its status as a Christmas film is disputed.\\n\\nPlot: On Christmas Eve, New York City Police Department (NYPD) Detective John McClane arrives in Los Angeles, hoping to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly, at a party held by her employer, the Nakatomi Corporation. He is driven to Nakatomi Plaza by a limo driver, Argyle, who offers to wait for McClane in the garage. While McClane changes clothes, the tower is seized by German radical Hans Gruber and his heavily armed team, including Karl and Theo. Everyone in the tower is taken hostage except for McClane, who slips away, and Argyle, who remains oblivious to events.\\nGruber is posing as a terrorist to steal the $640 million in untraceable bearer bonds in the building\\'s vault. He kills executive Joseph Takagi after failing to extract the access code from him, and tasks Theo with breaking into the vault. The terrorists are alerted to McClane\\'s presence and one of them, Tony, is sent after him. McClane kills Tony and takes his weapon and radio, which he uses to contact the skeptical Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Sergeant Al Powell is sent to investigate. Meanwhile, McClane kills more terrorists and recovers their bag of C-4 and detonators. Having found nothing amiss, Powell is about to leave until McClane drops a terrorist\\'s corpse onto his car. After Powell calls for backup, a SWAT team attempts to storm the building but is assaulted by the terrorists. McClane throws some C-4 down an elevator shaft, causing an explosion that kills some of the terrorists and ends the assault.\\nHolly\\'s co-worker Harry Ellis attempts to negotiate on Gruber\\'s behalf, but when McClane refuses to surrender, Gruber kills Ellis. While checking the explosives on the roof, Gruber encounters McClane and pretends to be an escaped hostage; McClane gives Gruber a gun. Gruber attempts to shoot McClane but finds the weapon is unloaded, and is saved only by the intervention of other terrorists. McClane escapes but is injured by shattered glass and loses the detonators. Outside, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents take control. They order the power to be shut off which, as Gruber had anticipated, disables the final vault lock so his team can collect the bonds.\\nThe FBI agrees to Gruber\\'s demand for a helicopter, intending to send gunship helicopters to eliminate the group. McClane realizes Gruber plans to blow the roof to kill the hostages and fake his team\\'s deaths. Karl, enraged by the death of his brother Tony, attacks McClane and is seemingly killed. Gruber sees a news report by Richard Thornburg on McClane\\'s children and deduces that he is Holly\\'s husband. The hostages are taken to the roof while Gruber keeps Holly with him. McClane drives the hostages from the roof just before Gruber detonates it and destroys the approaching FBI helicopters. Meanwhile, Theo retrieves an escape vehicle from the parking garage but is knocked out by Argyle, who has been following events on his car radio.\\nA weary and battered McClane finds Holly with Gruber and his remaining henchman. McClane surrenders to Gruber and is about to be shot, but grabs his concealed service pistol taped to his back and uses his last two bullets to wound Gruber and kill his accomplice. Gruber crashes through a window but grabs onto Holly\\'s wristwatch and makes a last-ditch attempt to kill the pair before McClane unclasps the watch and Gruber falls to his death. Outside, Karl ambushes McClane and Holly but is shot dead by Powell. Holly punches Thornburg when he attempts to interview McClane before Argyle crashes through the parking garage door in the limo and drives McClane and Holly away together.\\n'},\n",

Filmed in Romani and Serbo-Croatian, Time of the Gypsies tells the story of a young Romani man with magical powers who is tricked into engaging in petty crime. It is widely considered to be one of Kusturica\\'s best films. The film was recorded in Sarajevo, Skopje and Milan, by the Forum Sarajevo. The film was selected as the Yugoslav entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 62nd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.[1]\\nThe film revolves around Perhan, a Romani teenager with telekinetic powers and his passage from childhood to adulthood which starts in a little village in Yugoslavia and ends in the criminal underworld of Milan. The film deals with magic realism.\\nThe film\\'s soundtrack was composed by Goran Bregović.\\n\\nPlot: Perhan lives with his devoted grandmother Khatidza, his lame sister Danira and his dissolute uncle Merdzan. Khatidza possesses a level of supernatural powers (mainly healing) and Perhan himself inherited some minor telekinetic abilities. He wants to marry a girl named Azra, but her mother will not allow it, as Perhan is the illegitimate son of a Slovenian soldier who had an affair with Perhan\\'s late mother. Ahmed, the \"Gypsy sheik,\" comes to the village with his brothers. Merdzan loses his clothes playing cards with Ahmed\\'s brothers, and comes home desperate for money so that he can repay. It is raining and not finding any money, he accuses the grandmother of hiding the money from him and lifts the frame of the house up (using a rope and a truck), so that it is suspended in mid-air as the rain comes down on Perhan, his grandmother and Danira. Very soon after, Khatidza is summoned to use her powers to save Ahmed\\'s sick son, Roberto, which Khatidza does. For repayment, she proposes a deal with Ahmed - to pay for Danira\\'s leg to be healed at a hospital in Ljubljana. Perhan goes with Danira, promising his grandmother not to leave her, but Ahmed asks where will he stay and convinces him to go to Milan. At first Perhan wants to make money honestly, but after being dragged through the mud, Perhan begins stealing and squirreling money away in a shack.\\nAfter being double-crossed by his brother Sadam, Ahmed appoints Perhan boss of the operation. Now relatively rich, Perhan goes home, where he is enraged to find Azra is pregnant. Perhan refuses to believe that the baby is his. They marry with the condition that she would sell the baby. Perhan is also disappointed to find that the house Ahmed promised to build him is not being built at all, and that Danira was not operated on, but forced to be a beggar as part of Ahmed\\'s money operation. On their wedding night, Azra tells him the child is theirs, and was conceived when they made love on the Feast of St George. Still wearing her wedding dress, Azra dies after giving birth to a boy while levitating mid-air (a sign that the boy, as he inherited the powers, is indeed Perhan\\'s). Because Ahmed leaves with the baby, which we discover later is also named Perhan, he is raised by Ahmed\\'s crew.\\nAfter four years of searching, Perhan reunites with Danira in Rome, who leads him to Perhan Jr., whom Perhan now accepts as his child. Perhan drops the children off at the train station, promising to meet up with them after buying an accordion for his son and a present (sponges) for grandmother. The boy tells him he is mad at him because he will not return, and he will not get an accordion. Perhan assures him he will, \"Cross my gypsy heart,\" but immediately runs out of the station to settle the score with Ahmed, who is about to be married. Perhan arrives at the wedding and kills Ahmed with a fork, using his telekinetic powers. He also kills one of Ahmed\\'s brothers, but he is in turn killed by Ahmed\\'s new wife. At the funeral, the grandmother passes out drinks to everyone and Perhan Jr. goes outside the house, peers through the window at his dead father, breaks the glass and steals the golden coins put on his father\\'s eyes. Merdzan notices, and follows him out in the rain, as the child runs away hidden under a cardboard box. Merdzan is about to catch him up and pick up the board, but seems to have second thoughts, stops, and starts running toward the nearby church.\\n'},\n",

It did receive a nomination for Best Cinematography.\\n\\nPlot: In AD 859, as the Tang Dynasty declines, several rebel groups are established, the largest of which is the House of Flying Daggers, based in Fengtian, who battle the corrupt government that oppresses the people. Its members use special throwing daggers that always hit their targets to steal from the rich and give to the poor, gaining the support of the locals. Two police officers, Leo (Andy Lau) and Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro), are ordered to kill the leader of the group within ten days, a task that appears to be impossible as no one knows who the leader of the House of the Flying Daggers is.\\nTo accomplish this, Leo arrests Mei (Zhang Ziyi), a blind dancer who is suspected of being the previous leader\\'s daughter. Jin proceeds to assault the jail and set Mei free, pretending that he is a rebel sympathizer, an act which gains Mei\\'s trust. As Mei and Jin travel to the Flying Dagger headquarters, Leo trails behind with reinforcements. Unfortunately, Mei and Jin fall in love.\\nTo make the deception more realistic, Leo and his policemen pretend to ambush the pair. Later, though, they are ambushed for real by soldiers. At a secret meeting, Leo explains that the military has gotten involved and wants Jin and Mei dead. A few days later, Jin and Mei are ambushed again in a bamboo forest and almost killed, but they are saved by the House of Flying Daggers and taken to their headquarters. At this point, Mei is revealed to have been faking her blindness and is not the actual former leader\\'s daughter. Furthermore, she is engaged to Leo, who has also been revealed to have been pretending to be an officer but is really a Flying Daggers member. The Flying Daggers are not afraid of the military and are actually looking forward to an open battle. A heartbroken Leo tells Mei that he waited for her for three years since he went undercover to infiltrate the police, and asks how she could fall in love with Jin after only three days, only to be told she has her heart set on Jin.\\nLeo tries to attack Mei, but their superior Nia throws a dagger into Leo\\'s back and reassigns them to new missions, separating them. Shortly after, Mei is told to execute Jin. She frees him instead but refuses to desert the House to join him. Later, Mei changes her mind and rides after Jin, but is ambushed by Leo, who casts two daggers at her. Mei manages to deflect one of them while the other pierces her and seemingly kills her. At this point, Jin discovers Leo and the two of them fight, but their skills are too evenly matched. A raging blizzard falls upon them, while the military approaches the House.\\nFinally, with both men badly wounded and exhausted, Leo pulls Nia\\'s dagger out of his back and threatens to use it on Jin. Mei reappears and threatens to pull the dagger out of her breast and throw it at Leo, which would cause her to bleed to death, but Jin begs her to save herself. After several tense moments, Leo decides to pretend to throw his dagger, intending to die by Mei\\'s dagger while sparing Jin. However, Mei attempts to use her dagger to intercept Leo\\'s dagger in flight. The result is that neither Leo nor Jin dies, but only Mei. In the end, Leo stumbles away in guilt while Jin cries over Mei\\'s body, singing a song praising her as a \"rare beauty\", the likes of which he will never see again. Whether the House won against the military is left ambiguous.\\n'},\n",

It was written by Jim Kouf and the Wibberleys, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and directed by Jon Turteltaub. It is the first film in the National Treasure franchise and stars Nicolas Cage in the lead role, Harvey Keitel, Jon Voight, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, Justin Bartha and Christopher Plummer. In the film, Benjamin Franklin Gates, a historian, along with computer expert Riley Poole and archivist Abigail Chase, search for a massive lost Freemason treasure, to which a map is hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence.\\nNational Treasure was released worldwide on November 19, 2004. The film grossed $347 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the action scenes and performances but criticized the premise and screenplay. A sequel, National Treasure: Book of Secrets, was released in 2007.\\nAt the 2022 D23 Expo, a sequel TV series, National Treasure: Edge of History, was announced. It was released on the Disney+ streaming service on December 14, 2022.\\n\\nPlot: Benjamin Franklin Gates is an American historian, cryptographer, and treasure hunter. When Ben was young, his grandfather John told him that, in 1832, Charles Carroll passed on a secret to their ancestor of a fabled treasure hidden in America by the Knights Templar, Founding Fathers, and Freemasons. Carroll\\'s secret was a clue leading to the treasure: the phrase \"the secret lies with Charlotte\". While Ben is convinced by the story, his skeptical father, Patrick, dismisses it as nonsense.\\nThirty years later, Ben and his friend, computer expert Riley Poole, head an expedition financed by wealthy Ian Howe to find the Charlotte, revealed to be a ship lost in the Arctic. Within the ship, they find a meerschaum pipe, whose engravings reveal the next clue is on the Declaration of Independence. When Ian reveals himself to be a crime boss and suggests stealing the Declaration, a fight ensues, and the group splits. Ben and Riley report Ian\\'s plan to the FBI and Abigail Chase of the National Archives, but no one believes them. Ben decides to protect the Declaration by removing it from the Archives\\' preservation room during a gala event. Obtaining Abigail\\'s fingerprints, he successfully obtains the Declaration, only to be spotted by Ian\\'s group just as they break in to steal it. Ben tries to leave via the gift shop but has to pay for the Declaration when the cashier mistakes it for a souvenir copy. Suspecting something amiss, Abigail confronts Ben and takes back the document. Ian promptly kidnaps her, but Ben and Riley rescue Abigail, tricking Ian by leaving behind a souvenir copy of the Declaration. FBI Agent Sadusky begins tracking Ben down.\\nGoing to Patrick\\'s house, the trio studies the Declaration and discovers an Ottendorf cipher written in invisible ink. The message refers to Benjamin Franklin\\'s Silence Dogood letters. Patrick formerly owned them, but donated them to the Franklin Institute. Paying a schoolboy to view the letters and decipher the code for them, Ben, Riley, and Abigail discover a message pointing to the bell tower of Independence Hall. Pursued by Ian, they find a brick containing a pair of spectacles with multiple colored lenses, which, when used to read the back of the Declaration, reveal a clue pointing to Trinity Church. Ian\\'s associates chase the trio through Philadelphia until the FBI arrests Ben. Abigail and Riley lose the Declaration to Ian, but Abigail convinces Ian to help them rescue Ben in exchange for the next clue. Ian agrees, arranging a meeting at the USS Intrepid, where they help Ben evade the FBI.\\nIan returns the Declaration and asks for the next clue, but when Ben remains coy, Ian reveals he has taken Patrick hostage. They travel to the Trinity Church, where they find an underground passage that appears to lead to a dead end, lit by a lone lantern. Patrick claims it is a reference to the Midnight Ride of Paul Revere, pointing Ian to the Old North Church in Boston. Ian traps Ben, Abigail, Riley, and Patrick in the chamber, heading for Boston, which was Patrick\\'s intent as the clue was fictitious and he knew that Ian would betray them. Ben then finds a notch the meerschaum pipe fits into, opening a large chamber containing the treasure, with a staircase to the surface. Ben contacts Sadusky, who is actually a Freemason, and surrenders the Declaration and the treasure\\'s location in exchange for letting Abigail go free, giving the Gates family and Riley credit for the discovery, and no prison sentence. On a tip from Ben, the FBI arrests Ian for kidnapping and other crimes.\\nLater, Ben and Abigail have started a relationship, while Riley is somewhat upset that Ben turned down the 10% finder\\'s fee for the treasure so the entire collection could go to museums. But the 1% he did accept has still netted them all significant wealth.\\n'},\n",

In the film, the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) is shut down after being publicly implicated in a bombing of the Kremlin, causing Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his team to go without resources or backup in a life-threatening effort to clear their names.\\nDevelopment for Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol began in August 2009, when Appelbaum and Nemec were hired to write the screenplay (which contained rewrites by eventual series director and writer Christopher McQuarrie). Cruise\\'s return was confirmed by March 2010 after Bird was announced to replace J. J. Abrams, who directed the predecessor. The film was officially titled in October 2010, after which, principal photography took place and lasted until March 2011, with filming locations including Bangalore, Mumbai, Budapest, Moscow, Dubai, and Canadian Motion Picture Park Studios in Vancouver. Like previous entries in the franchise, the cast completed most of their own stunts, while parts of the film were shot in IMAX.\\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol premiered in Dubai on December 7, 2011, and was released in IMAX and select large-format theaters on December 16, before being theatrically released in the United States by Paramount Pictures on December 21.

The film was followed by Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation in 2015.\\n\\nPlot: IMF agent Trevor Hanaway is killed in Budapest by assassin Sabine Moreau, who steals Russian nuclear launch codes to sell to a man named \"Cobalt\". IMF agent Ethan Hunt is extracted from a Moscow prison, along with an asset named Bogdan, by Hanaway\\'s handler and girlfriend Jane Carter and newly-promoted field agent Benji Dunn. The team is ordered to infiltrate the Kremlin for information on Cobalt. While they are inside, Cobalt blows the team\\'s cover and they escape before a bomb destroys much of the Kremlin. Jane and Benji escape, but Ethan is arrested by SVR agent Anatoly Sidorov and is blamed for the bombing.\\nEthan escapes and meets with the IMF Secretary, who is in Moscow with analyst William Brandt. Brandt identifies Cobalt as Kurt Hendricks, a strategist seeking nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia. They determine that Hendricks bombed the Kremlin to cover his theft of a Russian launch control device. The Secretary explains that the President has initiated \"Ghost Protocol\", disavowing the entire IMF. He instead orders Ethan to continue pursuing Cobalt before they are suddenly attacked by Sidorov\\'s forces and the Secretary is killed. Ethan escapes with Brandt and regroups with Jane and Benji. They plan to infiltrate a meeting between Hendricks\\' associate, Wistrom, and Moreau at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai where Wistrom will buy the stolen launch codes. Wistrom is accompanied by Leonid Lisenker, a Polish cryptographer who is blackmailed by Hendricks to authenticate the codes. \\nThe IMF team plans to intercept the codes by faking two meetings: Ethan and Brandt posing as Wistrom and Lisenker to receive the codes from the real Moreau while, one floor away, Jane poses as Moreau, passing counterfeit ones to the real Wistrom and Lisenker. However, because of Lisenker\\'s ability to identify fakes, they are forced to give the real codes, relying on radioactive isotopes on the paper to track Wistrom afterwards. Completing the buy, Wistrom murders Lisenker. Moreau, having deduced that the buy is a setup, attempts to flee, but Jane intercepts her. As Moreau attacks Benji while trying to escape, Jane kicks her out a window to her death. Sidorov attempts but fails to apprehend Ethan.\\nEthan pursues Wistrom, who escapes and reveals himself to be a masked Hendricks, while Jane and Benji confront Brandt over his unusual fighting skills in the hotel. Brandt admits to Jane and Benji that he resigned as a field agent after failing to protect Julia Meade, Ethan\\'s wife, from a hit. Ethan is taken by Bogdan to the Fog, an arms dealer, and learns that Hendricks is buying an obsolete Soviet military satellite from Indian media tycoon Brij Nath. The Fog later gives the same information to Sidorov, in return for clearing his rap sheet. In Mumbai, Jane seduces Nath, then overpowers him to get the satellite\\'s override code; the team then pursues Hendricks and Wistrom to one of Nath\\'s broadcast stations to stop him from sending the codes via the satellite. \\nHendricks sends launch orders to a Russian nuclear submarine to fire a missile at San Francisco, while Wistrom sabotages the station system to prevent IMF interference. Benji, Brandt, and Jane attempt to repair the station while Ethan pursues Hendricks. Cornered by Ethan, Hendricks jumps to his death in order to place the launch device out of reach. After Benji kills Wistrom, Jane reconnects the system and Ethan successfully retrieves the launch device to disable the missile moments before detonation. Sidorov and his men arrive, only to realise that Ethan was giving him clues to track them and that the IMF was innocent of the Kremlin bombing, and offers Ethan a ride to the hospital.\\nIn Seattle, Ethan assembles his team for another mission given by Luther Stickell. Brandt confesses to Ethan his failure to protect Julia, but Ethan reveals that she is alive and her death was staged to give her a new identity safely away from him, and to let him infiltrate the prison to find Bogdan. A relieved Brandt accepts his mission and agrees to become an agent again. Julia arrives at the harbour and spots Ethan watching her from a distance, as they share a warm smile. As he leaves, Ethan receives a debrief about a breach in the IMF\\'s military communications network by an emerging terrorist network known as The Syndicate, disappearing into the fog as he listens to it.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'The Italian Job is a 1969 British comedy caper film, written by Troy Kennedy Martin, produced by Michael Deeley, directed by Peter Collinson, and starring Michael Caine. The film\\'s plot centres around Cockney criminal Charlie Croker, recently released from prison, who forms a gang for the job of stealing a cache of gold bullion being transported through the city of Turin, Italy, in an armoured security truck. In addition to Caine, the cast also included Benny Hill, Raf Vallone, Tony Beckley, and Noël Coward; the film was Coward\\'s last before his retirement from acting. The soundtrack was composed by Quincy Jones, featuring the songs \"On Days Like These\", sung by Matt Monro over the opening credits, and \"Getta Bloomin\\' Move On\" (usually referred to as \"The Self-Preservation Society\", after its chorus) during the climactic car chase, which featured Caine among its singers.[3]\\nThe film proved a success upon its release, earning critical acclaim amongst critics for the performances by Caine and Coward, the film\\'s reflection of British culture from the period, and the climactic car chase. The Italian Job became a cult symbol of British filmography and was ranked favourably in the top 100 British films by the British Film Institute. Several elements became symbolic cult features, including the cliffhanger ending,[4][5] and Caine\\'s famous line about only blowing the doors off.\\nThe popularity of The Italian Job led to several parodies and allusions in other films and productions, including the 2005 episode of The Simpsons titled \"The Italian Bob\", and a re-enactment of the Mini Cooper car-chase in the MacGyver episode \"Thief of Budapest\".[6][7][8] The film itself was later given a video game adaptation in 2001, before receiving a remake in 2003. A charity event titled The Italian Job, founded in 1990 and held annually, was inspired by the film; as of 2020[update], it had raised nearly £3,000,000.[9] Marking the 50th anniversary of the film in June 2019, stunt drivers in red, white and blue Coopers recreated parts of the film\\'s car-chase around Turin at the grounds of Mini\\'s Oxford factory.[10]\\n\\nPlot: Driving through the Alps, thief Roger Beckermann is killed when his car crashes into a bulldozer parked in a tunnel by the Mafia, who dispose of him and his car by pushing it into a nearby river. Meanwhile, his friend and fellow thief Charlie Croker is released from prison, reuniting with his girlfriend Lorna to enjoy his first taste of freedom. Leaving her to meet with Beckermann for a job he was planning in Italy, Croker is shocked to meet his widow instead. She insists he continue her late husband\\'s plan, which he had completed before his death, of an ambitious heist of $4 million in gold bullion from a security convoy intended as a down payment to Fiat by China for a car factory.\\nCroker breaks back into prison to ask British nationalist crime lord Mr. Bridger for financial backing. Initially unconvinced, Bridger soon offers support when he learns of the heist\\'s target. With help from Bridger\\'s organisation, run by his right-hand man Camp Freddie, Croker recruits a crew of specialists, including Lorna and computer expert Professor Peach – the latter needed for sabotaging Turin\\'s traffic control system. After finalising preparations, Croker and his team are summoned by Bridger to a fake funeral ceremony, where he informs them that the Mafia killed Beckermann because of his planned heist, advising them to be careful, but not to return without the gold.\\nAfter leaving for Italy, Croker and some of his crew split off from the others while en route to Turin, to avoid raising suspicion. However, the small group soon encounter the Mafia waiting for them in the Alps, led by their boss Altabani, who destroys their cars. Croker narrowly manages to talk his way out of getting murdered. His crew infiltrate the Turin traffic control centre later that night, whereupon Peach replaces one of the computer\\'s magnetic tape data storage reels with a duplicate designed to sabotage Turin\\'s traffic control system on the day of the heist. The next day, as the gold arrives and the crew prepare for the heist, Croker sends Lorna to Geneva to protect her and the plan. At the same time, Peach absconds from the crew, and is later arrested for molesting a woman on a tram.\\nWith the city\\'s closed circuit television traffic monitoring cameras sabotaged and the Turin traffic control system malfunctioning, a massive traffic jam builds up. The crew swiftly ambush the gold convoy outside the Museo Egizio as it is stalled by the traffic jam. Subduing the police and moving the van inside the building, they divide the gold between the boots of three Mini Coopers. Most of the crew then escape the building disguised as football fans, while Croker leads the rest out of the city in the Minis, going over stairs, pedestrian streets, rooftops and sewers. Following a set route designed by Beckermann, the crew escape from Turin with the gold, and rendezvous with a modified coach to collect the Minis before they reach the Alps. Once aboard, the group unload the gold, dispose of the Minis in the Alps, and collect the rest of the crew.\\nAs Bridger celebrates with his fellow prisoners and prison staff, the coach suddenly loses control and teeters over a cliff, with the gold balancing over the edge. Croker soon contemplates how to save the crew and the gold, which is sliding further away down the vehicle, and claims \"hang on a minute lads, I\\'ve got a great idea.\"\\n'},\n",

Under Asaji\\'s influence, Washizu is unsure of Miki\\'s loyalty, but chooses Miki\\'s son as his heir because he and Asaji have no child of their own. Washizu plans to tell Miki and his son about his decision at a grand banquet. However, Asaji tells him that she is pregnant, which leaves him with a quandary concerning his heir; now Miki and his son have to be eliminated.\\nDuring the banquet, Washizu is agitated because Miki and his son have not shown up, and drinks sake copiously. He loses his self-control when Miki\\'s ghost suddenly appears. In a delusional panic, he reveals what has happened to Miki by exclaiming that he is willing to slay Miki a second time, unsheathing his sword and slashing at the empty air near Miki\\'s seat.

Seeking shelter, he learns from a anthropomorphic nine-banded armadillo named Roadkill, who is seeking the mystical \"Spirit of the West\", and tells the chameleon of an Old West desert town called Dirt, where water comes in through a mysterious rite on Wednesdays. Seeing no other options, the chameleon heads out into the desert, where he narrowly avoids being eaten by a vicious red-tailed hawk before meeting Beans, a anthropomorphic desert iguana rancher, who takes him to the Town of Dirt full of anthropomorphic animals.\\nAsked about his identity, the chameleon presents himself to the townsfolk as a tough drifter named \"Rango\" and quickly runs afoul of anthropomorphic Gila monster Bad Bill, who challenges him to a duel. The hawk interrupts the duel and chases Rango, who accidentally knocks over an empty water tower and crushes the hawk to death. Believing he did so intentionally, the townsfolk praise Rango, who is appointed as the new sheriff by Dirt\\'s anthropomorphic desert tortoise Mayor John. Meanwhile, the townsfolk, Most notably a Native American Crow named  Wounded Bird, worry that with the hawk dead, the infamous gunslinger Rattlesnake Jake the scary evil villianous anthropomorphic Snake will return.\\nWith the town desperate for water during a drought, Beans demands that Rango investigates where the water has gone and in doing so, he inadvertently helps a gang of bank robbers, led by a anthropomorphic mole named Balthazar, to steal the water supply.

Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a Jewish Italian bookshop owner, who employs his imagination to shield his son from the horrors of internment in a Nazi concentration camp. The film was partially inspired by the book In the End, I Beat Hitler by Rubino Romeo Salmonì and by Benigni\\'s father, who spent two years in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp during World War II.\\nThe film was an overwhelming critical and commercial success. It received widespread acclaim, with critics praising its story, performances, direction and the union of drama and comedy, despite some criticisms of using the subject matter for comedic purposes. The movie grossed over $230\\xa0million worldwide, including $57.6 million in the United States, is the second highest-grossing foreign language film in the U.S. (after Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon)[4] and one of the highest-grossing non-English language movies of all time.[5] The National Board of Review included it in the top five best foreign films of 1998.[6]\\nThe movie won the Grand Prix at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, nine David di Donatello Awards (including Best Film), five Nastro d\\'Argento Awards in Italy, two European Film Awards, and three Academy Awards, including Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actor for Benigni, the first for a male non-English performance.[7]\\n\\nPlot: In 1939, in Fascist Italy, Guido Orefice is a young Italian Jewish man who arrives to work in the city of Arezzo, in Tuscany, where his uncle Eliseo works in the restaurant of a hotel. Guido is comical and sharp and falls in love with a Gentile girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to Rodolfo, a rich but arrogant local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many \"coincidental\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. \\nFinally, Dora sees Guido\\'s affection and promise and gives in, against her better judgment. He steals the lady from her engagement party, on a horse, humiliating her fiancé and mother. They are later married, have a son Giosuè, and run a bookstore.\\nDuring World War II, in 1944 when Northern Italy is occupied by Nazi Germany, Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosuè are seized on Giosuè\\'s birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train bound for a concentration camp. After confronting a guard about her husband and son and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. \\nHowever, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido do not see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp\\'s loudspeaker to send messages—symbolic or literal—to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is murdered in a gas chamber shortly after their arrival. Giosuè narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers and were told they were showers.\\nIn the camp, Guido hides the true situation from his son. Guido tells Giosuè that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Each of the tasks will earn them points and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Giosuè is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido convinces him each time to continue. \\nAt one point Guido takes advantage of the appearance of visiting German officers and their families to show Giosuè that other children are hiding as part of the game, and he also takes advantage of a German nanny thinking Giosuè is one of her charges in order to feed him as Guido serves the German officers. Guido and Giosuè are almost found out to be prisoners by another server until Guido is found teaching all of the German children how to say \"Thank you\" in Italian, effectively providing a ruse.\\nGuido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the Allied forces approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final task in the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but he is caught by a German soldier. An officer orders Guido to be executed and Guido is led off by the soldier. While he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosuè one last time and winks, still in character and playing the game. Guido is then shot and left for dead in an alleyway. \\nThe next morning, Giosuè emerges from the sweat-box, just as a U.S. Army unit led by a Sherman tank arrives and the camp is liberated. Giosuè is overjoyed about winning the game (unaware that his father is dead), thinking that he won the tank, and an American soldier allows Giosuè to ride on the tank. \\nWhile traveling to safety, Giosuè soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with his mother. While the young Giosuè excitedly tells his mother about how he had won a tank, just as his father had promised, the adult Giosuè, in an overheard monologue, reminisces on the sacrifices his father made for him and his story.\\n'},\n",

The film stars Sacha Baron\\xa0Cohen as the fictional Kazakh journalist and television personality Borat Sagdiyev, and Maria Bakalova as his daughter Tutar, who is to be offered as a bride to then-U.S. vice president Mike Pence during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential election. It is a sequel to 2006\\'s Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.\\nAlthough Baron\\xa0Cohen had said in 2007 that he had retired the Borat character, he was spotted in 2019 in the disguise, and was seen filming in mid-2020, leading to speculation of a second Borat film. The project was officially announced in September 2020, with Amazon Studios acquiring the distribution rights. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm was released on October\\xa023, 2020, on Amazon Prime Video. It received praise from critics for Baron\\xa0Cohen\\'s and Bakalova\\'s performances, as well as for its commentary on American culture; former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani\\'s appearance, however, was polarizing. The film received three nominations at the 78th Golden Globe Awards, winning for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Baron Cohen and Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. At the 93rd Academy Awards, it was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Bakalova.

The screenplay won at the 73rd Writers Guild of America Awards.\\n\\nPlot: After fourteen years of forced labor in a gulag for the dishonor inflicted on his country in his previous adventure, Kazakh journalist Borat Sagdiyev is released by his country\\'s president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, with a mission to deliver Kazakh Minister of Culture (and Kazakhstan\\'s most famous porn actor) Johnny the Monkey to President Donald Trump in an attempt to redeem the nation. Unable to get close to Trump after defecating in the landscaping of Trump International Hotel and Tower in the previous film, Borat opts to give the monkey to Vice President Mikhael Pence. Before leaving, he discovers that his arch nemesis neighbor, Nursultan Tulyakbay, has stolen his family and home, and that he has a fifteen-year-old daughter, Tutar, who lives in his barn.\\nBorat is transported across the world in a circuitous route by cargo ship and arrives in Galveston, Texas, where he finds he is a celebrity. Wanting to maintain a low profile, Borat purchases multiple disguises. He buys a cell phone and goes to welcome Johnny, but finds that Tutar is in Johnny\\'s shipping crate and has eaten him. Horrified, Borat faxes Nazarbayev, who tells him to find a way to satisfy Pence or he will be executed. Borat decides to give Tutar to Pence.\\nTutar receives a makeover and Borat introduces her at a debutante ball. At the ball, her menstrual blood is prominently displayed during a father and daughter dance. Discovering that Pence is nearby at CPAC, Borat disguises himself as Trump and attempts to give Tutar to him there, but is ejected by security. Nazarbayev is enraged and tells him to return to Kazakhstan for execution. Realizing that he can still give Tutar to someone close to Trump, Tutar suggests giving her to Rudy Giuliani.\\nBecause Giuliani had bragged about having an affair with a large-breasted woman, Borat brings Tutar to a cosmetic surgeon who advises breast implants. While Borat works in a barbershop to raise enough money to pay for breast surgery, he briefly leaves Tutar with a babysitter who is confused by Borat\\'s sexist teachings. She informs Tutar that the things her culture has taught her are lies. After Tutar sees a woman driving a car, and successfully masturbates for the first time, she decides not to get the surgery and lashes out at Borat for keeping her oppressed her whole life. Before leaving, she tells him the Holocaust, their country’s \"greatest accomplishment\" is a lie by citing a Holocaust denial Facebook page.\\nShaken, Borat decides to commit suicide by going to the nearest synagogue dressed as his version of a stereotypical Jew and waiting for the next mass shooting, but is shocked to find Holocaust survivors there who treat him with kindness, and to his anti-Semitic delight, reassure him that the Holocaust happened. Overjoyed, Borat goes looking for Tutar, but finds the streets deserted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He quarantines with two QAnon conspiracy theorists who offer to help him reunite with Tutar. They find Tutar online, who has become a reporter and will be covering a March for Our Rights rally in Olympia, Washington.\\nAt the rally, the men appeal to Tutar, telling her that her dad will be killed unless she helps. She accepts and arranges an interview to seduce Giuliani, but without her father\\'s participation. Borat talks with her babysitter and has a change of heart, realizing that he loves Tutar. After the interview, Giuliani and Tutar proceed to a bedroom before Borat intervenes and tries to personally offer sexual favors to Giuliani. Borat decides to face execution in Kazakhstan and Tutar promises to go with him.\\nBorat is shocked to find he will not be executed as he had instead been used as retaliation by Nazarbayev for making Kazakhstan a laughingstock. Before departing for the United States, Kazakhstan officials infected Borat with SARS-CoV-2 via an injection of \"gypsy tears\", making him patient zero of the COVID-19 pandemic. As he was sent around the world, he continued to spread the virus. Borat uses a recording made near the beginning of his trip to convince Nazarbayev that his admission has been recorded and sent to Brian, the man who sold Borat his phone, and whom Borat claims is America\\'s Minister of Technology.\\nBorat and Tutar blackmail Nazarbayev into giving him his job back and changing Kazakhstan\\'s misogynistic laws. Three months later, Tutar and Borat are a reporting team and Kazakhstan has a new tradition to replace the nation\\'s antisemitic ones: the Running of the American. It features exaggerated caricatures of Trump supporters and \"Karens\" pretending to spread COVID-19 and killing an effigy of Anthony Fauci. The film ends with a message encouraging viewers to vote in the then-upcoming presidential election.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'The Dictator is a 2012 political satire black comedy film co-written by and starring Sacha Baron Cohen as his fourth feature film in a leading role. The film is directed by Larry Charles, who previously directed Baron Cohen\\'s mockumentaries Borat and Brüno. Baron Cohen, in the role of Admiral General Aladeen, the dictator of the fictional Republic of Wadiya visiting the United States, stars alongside Anna Faris, Ben Kingsley, and Jason Mantzoukas with uncredited appearances by John C. Reilly and Garry Shandling.\\nProducers Jeff Schaffer and David Mandel said that Baron Cohen\\'s character was inspired by real-life dictators like Kim Jong-il, Idi Amin, Muammar Gaddafi, Mobutu Sese Seko, and Saparmurat Niyazov.[6] The film\\'s opening credits sarcastically dedicate it \"in loving memory\" to Kim Jong-il. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $179 million.\\n\\nPlot: For 40 years, the fictional North African state of Wadiya (shown as coterminous with the boundaries of Eritrea on the map) has been ruled by Admiral-General Haffaz Aladeen, a childish, sexist, anti-Western, and antisemitic dictator who surrounds himself with female bodyguards, sponsors terrorism (especially giving shelter to al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after \"they killed his double one year ago\"), changes many words in the Wadiyan dictionary to \"Aladeen\", and is working on developing nuclear weapons to \"destroy Israel\". He also refuses to sell Wadiya\\'s oil fields, a promise he made to his father before his death. After the United Nations Security Council resolves to intervene militarily, Aladeen travels to the UN Headquarters in New York City to address the council.\\nShortly after arriving, Aladeen is kidnapped by Clayton, supposedly in charge of the security preparations but actually a hitman hired by his treacherous uncle Tamir, whom Aladeen\\'s father passed over as successor in favor of his son. Tamir then replaces Aladeen with a moronic look-alike named Efawadh, whom he intends to manipulate into signing a document nominally democratizing Wadiya while opening up the country\\'s oil fields to foreign vested interests. Aladeen escapes after Clayton accidentally burns himself to death in a failed torture attempt. When his burnt corpse is discovered, Tamir thinks Aladeen has been killed. However, Aladeen is practically unrecognizable as Clayton shaved off his iconic beard prior to his death.\\nWandering through New York City in civilian clothes, Aladeen (assuming the false identity of \"Allison Burgers\") encounters Zoey, a human rights activist who offers him a job at her socially progressive, alternative lifestyle co-op. Aladeen refuses the offer and encounters \"Nuclear\" Nadal, the former chief of Wadiya\\'s nuclear weapons programme, whom Aladeen thought he had previously executed over an argument about the warhead\\'s design. Aladeen follows him to New York\\'s \"Little Wadiya\" district, which is populated by refugees from his own country, and meets him in \"Death to Aladeen Restaurant\", a restaurant run by and visited by numerous people whom Aladeen had ordered to be executed. After a failed attempt to cover up his identity, Aladeen is accused of being an \"Aladeen sympathizer\" by the restaurant\\'s waiter and the refugees. Nadal saves Aladeen from being attacked and reveals to Aladeen that all the people he had ordered to be executed are instead sent into exile to the United States, as the executioner is a member of the resistance movement. Nadal agrees to help Aladeen thwart Tamir\\'s plot and regain his power, on condition that Aladeen makes him head of Wadiya\\'s nuclear programme again. Aladeen agrees and accepts Zoey\\'s job offer, as she is catering at the hotel where the signing is to occur. Aladeen grows closer to Zoey after she refuses his sexual advances and teaches him how to masturbate, and eventually falls in love with her after seeing her angry. Turning around Zoey\\'s struggling business, Aladeen begins imposing strict schedules on everyone, forming a personality cult around Zoey and intimidating an inspector into giving the store a good review.\\nHowever, Aladeen\\'s relationship with Zoey becomes strained after he decides to be honest with her and reveal his true self; she cannot love a man who was so brutal to his own people. After acquiring a new beard taken from a corpse, Aladeen ziplines into the hotel and tells Efawadh he has recovered; his double was fooled into thinking the Supreme Leader was ill. At the signing ceremony, he tears up Tamir\\'s document in front of the media and holds an impassioned speech praising the virtues of dictatorship, drawing unintended parallels to current issues in the United States. However, upon seeing Zoey in the room, he declares his love for her and, knowing Zoey\\'s strongly-held views, vows to democratize his country and open up Wadiya\\'s oil fields for business, but in a way where the general populace will benefit. Furious with Aladeen staying in power, Tamir attempts to shoot him but Efawadh jumps in front of the bullet and survives, as it is his job \"to be shot in the head\". Tamir is arrested afterwards.\\nA year later, Wadiya holds its first democratic elections, although they are rigged in favor of Aladeen (who has now added the title \"President Prime Minister\" to his previous Admiral-General). Afterwards, he marries Zoey, but is shocked when she breaks a glass with her foot and reveals herself to be Jewish; throughout the film he was shown vowing to destroy Israel. Scenes during the credits show Aladeen\\'s convoy, now consisting of eco-friendly cars, Aladeen visiting a re-instated Nadal, and later Zoey revealing in a television interview that she is pregnant with the couple\\'s first child. Aladeen responds to the news by asking if Zoey is having \"a boy or an abortion\".\\n'},\n",

It is the third and final installment in the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, after Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Hot Fuzz (2007). It stars Pegg, Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan, Rosamund Pike, and Pierce Brosnan. In the film, five friends return to their hometown to reattempt a pub crawl they failed twenty-three years earlier, only to discover the town is in the midst of an alien invasion.\\nThe film entered initial development in 1995 after Wright wrote a screenplay titled Crawl about teenagers on a pub crawl; after deciding it was better suited as a comedic exploration of young adulthood and aging, he reworked the screenplay with Pegg in the early 2010s. The film was produced by Relativity Media, Big Talk Productions, and Working Title Films.[5] Principal photography began on 28 September 2012 and lasted until that December, with filming locations including Elstree Studios, Letchworth Garden City, and Welwyn Garden City. The film\\'s stunts were coordinated by members of Jackie Chan Stunt Team, and The World\\'s End is considered a social science fiction film.[6]\\nThe World\\'s End premiered at Leicester Square in London on 10 July 2013, and was first theatrically released in the United Kingdom by Universal Pictures nine days later. It was later released in the United States by Focus Features on 23 August. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the screenplay, performances of the cast, humour, and Wright\\'s direction. It won Best British Film at the 19th Empire Awards, and was nominated for Best Comedy at the 19th Critics\\' Choice Awards. The World\\'s End was also a commercial success, grossing $46.1 million worldwide.\\n\\nPlot: On 22 June 1990, in the small town of Newton Haven, five teenage friends: Gary King, Andrew \"Andy\" Knightley, Oliver Chamberlain, Steven Prince and Peter Page celebrate their last day of school by competing in the Golden Mile, a pub crawl consisting of twelve pubs, with the last of them being the World\\'s End. After Oliver and Peter lose the challenge, the remaining teens fail to finish the final three pubs.\\nTwenty-three years later, Gary is now 40 years old and still living out his teen years, while Andy, Oliver, Steven and Peter have all matured, with successful careers and lifestyles. Following a rehabilitation session, Gary, wanting to relive the glory days, decides to complete the Golden Mile and invites the group to compete with him. While the others reluctantly accept, Andy initially refuses to participate, holding a strong grudge against Gary due to a drunk driving incident in 1997 involving himself and Gary, prompting Andy to become a teetotaler. But when Gary informs him about his mother\\'s death, Andy decides to join the crawl.\\nThe group encounters Oliver\\'s sister, Sam, over whom Gary and Steven fought in school; during the teenage crawl, Gary had sex with Sam in a pub toilet. The town residents do not recognise the group, except for one bartender who tells them that they are banned. After Peter encounters Shane Hawkins, his childhood bully who does not seem to remember him, Gary interrupts Peter\\'s account of his torment after going off to buy a round of shots. Angry and upset at the group after they admonish him for his childishness, stubbornness and selective memory, Gary goes to the toilet, where he gets into a fight with a teenager and knocks his head off, exposing him as an android. As Gary\\'s friends find him in the toilet to confront him over lying about his mother\\'s death, the other members of the teen\\'s gang, all androids, enter the toilet and engage in a battle against the human friends. The group realises that most of the town has been replaced with androids (which they dub \"Blanks\"), explaining why no one remembers them. Shocked and overwhelmed, Andy starts drinking again.\\nGary urges them to continue the pub crawl to avoid suspicion, which the rest of the group agree to only because of Gary\\'s stubbornness. The group bumps into Sam once more. Sam, Gary, and Steven fight Blank versions of Sam\\'s childhood friends, known as the \"twins\". Sam tags along with them, and Steven is told by Basil, another resident known as an eccentric conspiracy theorist who has not yet been replaced by a Blank, that the Blanks are trying to build a galactic conglomerate and that any humans refusing will be replaced with identical simulants. Sam realises this independently after witnessing someone who she knew died in a motorcycle crash eight years earlier. The Blanks attempt to convince the humans to join their assimilation. Unwilling to lose their humanity and, finding out that both Oliver and their old school teacher, Mr. Shepherd, have been replaced, the group fights a bar full of Blanks. The surviving members of the group realise, after noticing that Oliver\\'s surgically-removed \"6\"-shaped birth mark had returned, that Blanks cannot replicate scarification, prompting them all, except Gary, to show each other their childhood scars (all of which were in some way caused by Gary).\\nGary lets Sam escape Newton Haven by herself; Pete gets captured after attacking Shane\\'s Blank; and when Andy and Steven want to go home, Gary ditches them to finish the Golden Mile alone. Andy and Steven chase after Gary, as does the rest of Newton Haven, and Steven is captured. After being confronted by Andy, Gary reveals his recent suicide attempt and his jealousy of Andy\\'s seemingly fulfilled adult life; Andy reveals that his marriage is troubled. Andy tries to stop Gary from drawing his final pint, but Gary is determined to complete the Mile, believing that it is all he has left.\\nWhen Gary pulls the lever to pour himself a pint, the floor lowers into a hidden chamber. A disembodied alien entity, the Network, tells Gary and Andy that the Blank invasion is the first step to humanity joining a galactic community. The Network offers Gary eternal youth if he becomes a Blank, but he refuses and decapitates his Blank self. Along with Andy and Steven, who has survived, Gary demands that humanity be left to its own devices, stating that all but three of Newton Haven residents have been replaced with Blanks, and expressing horror at how humans that have been replaced have been composted. The Network, exasperated, agrees to abandon the invasion. Sam rescues Gary, Andy, and Steven as the town is destroyed, but they are unable to outrun the electromagnetic pulse triggered by the departure of the Network, which deactivates Sam\\'s car. Staring out onto the destruction, Gary tearfully apologises to Andy.\\nSome time later, Andy relates to other survivors of the pulse that it triggered a worldwide blackout that destroyed all electrical power on Earth, sending humanity back to the Dark Ages and killing an unknown number of humans in the process. The remaining Blanks reactivated a few weeks later and, although they are now independent from the Network, they are mistrusted and shunned by most of the surviving humans. Andy\\'s marriage has recovered, Steven is in a relationship with Sam, and the Blank versions of Peter and Oliver have picked up where their human versions left off. Andy relates that he has no idea what happened to Gary.\\nIn the ruins of Newton Haven, the now-sober Gary enters a pub with the Blank versions of his younger friends and orders water. When the bartender refuses to serve Blanks, Gary leads his friends into a brawl.\\n'},\n",

The film, which explores themes of reincarnation, centers on the last days in the life of its title character, who is played by Thanapat Saisaymar. Together with his loved ones—including the spirit of his dead wife, Huay, and his lost son, Boonsong, who has returned in a non-human form—Boonmee explores his past lives as he contemplates the reasons for his illness.[1]\\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives was inspired by the 1983 book A Man Who Can Recall His Past Lives by Buddhist abbot Phra Sripariyattiweti. The film is the final installment in a multi-platform art project by Apichatpong Weerasethakul called \"Primitive\". It premiered at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d\\'Or, becoming the first Thai film to do so.[2]\\n\\nPlot: In a grassy area, a water buffalo breaks free from a rope tethering it to a tree. It wanders into a forest, where it is spotted by a man holding a sickle. The man begins to lead it somewhere, while a silhouetted figure with red eyes watches.\\nBoonmee lives in a house on a farm with his sister-in-law Jen and his nephew Tong. Boonmee is suffering from a failing kidney; his Laotian assistant Jaai administers dialysis treatments to him. One night, while Boonmee, Jen and Tong are eating dinner together, the ghost of Boonmee\\'s wife Huay appears. Huay, who died over a decade prior, says that she heard Jen and Boonmee\\'s prayers for her, and is aware of Boonmee\\'s poor health. A hairy, red-eyed figure ascends the stairs near the dinner table, and is revealed to be Boonmee\\'s long-lost son Boonsong. Boonsong, who practiced photography, had disappeared some years after Huay died. Boonsong was searching for a creature—whom he calls a \"Monkey Ghost\"—that he had captured in one of his photos. He says that he mated with a Monkey Ghost, causing his hair to grow longer and his pupils to dilate, and that, after meeting his mate, he forgot \"the old world\".\\nDuring the day, on the farm with Jen, Boonmee asserts that his illness is a result of karma. He claims that it was caused by his killing of communists while serving in the military, and his killing of bugs on the farm.\\nA princess is carried through a forest in a litter. She walks near a waterfall, and gazes into her reflection in the water, which she perceives to be more youthful and beautiful than her real appearance. She is kissed by one of her servants, but insists that he imagined kissing her reflection. The servant departs, and she sits by the water and weeps. She is complimented by a catfish, prompting her to wade into the water. She makes offerings of her jewelry in return for being made to look like her reflection, and then has intercourse with the catfish.\\nBoonmee lies in bed near a sitting Huay. He hugs her, and asks about how he might be able to find her in the afterlife. She tells him that the spirits of the deceased are not attached to locations, but to people. Later, Boonmee, Huay, Jen and Tong venture out into the forest. Jen and Tong see shadowy figures running through the brush and leaping between the trees. Huay leads Boonmee, Jen and Tong into a cave. Boonmee believes that he was born in the cave, in a life that he cannot recall. He recounts a dream of a future civilisation in which authorities shine \"a light\" on \"past people\", causing them to disappear. Huay disconnects Boonmee\\'s dialysis tube. By the next day, Boonmee is dead.\\nFollowing Boonmee\\'s funeral, Jen sits on a bed, organising gifts of baht with her friend Roong. Tong, now a monk, arrives, saying that he has been having difficulty sleeping at the temple. He showers and changes from his robes to a T-shirt and jeans. While preparing to go out to eat with Jen, he is stunned to see himself, Jen and Roong on the bed, watching television. He and Jen leave for a restaurant, while he, Jen and Roong remain on the bed.\\n'},\n",

Mesmerized by Ramona\\'s performance and the tips she earns, Destiny meets her on the roof of the club. Ramona agrees to take Destiny under her wing, and the two form a formidable team. Destiny enjoys newfound wealth and friendship with Ramona. A year later, the financial crisis of 2007–2008 strikes, and both women find themselves short of cash. Destiny becomes pregnant.

Moves has changed: the financial crisis has impacted their business, and the club is primarily staffed by immigrant women willing to perform sex acts for money, a line Destiny is unwilling to cross, but she does in a moment of desperation. She reconnects with Ramona, who introduces her to a new scheme. Along with her two protégées, Mercedes and Annabelle, Ramona targets rich men at bars, gets them drunk, and then escorts them to Moves where the girls steal their credit card numbers and charge them to their limit. Destiny joins in, and learns that Ramona uses a mix of ketamine and MDMA to impair judgment and cause memory loss in their targets, a tactic deemed worthwhile since their victims will rarely admit to being robbed by strippers.\\nThe scheme works, and the women enjoy their new source of wealth. When some of the targets prove too aggressive for Mercedes and Annabelle to handle, Destiny suggests bringing in other girls, who are carefully trained to avoid drinking or using drugs. Ramona\\'s partnership with Moves makes the credit card fraud lucrative for them. However, cracks start to show in their operation. Other strippers begin to emulate their strategies. Furious, Ramona cuts her business ties with Moves, and the group begins to service clients in hotel rooms or their own homes.

Ramona\\'s callousness drives a wedge between the women, and Destiny feels she can no longer justify her crimes. Dawn is picked up by the police and \"flips\" on her partners, while investigators manage to locate several victims and identify all of the girls. Destiny, Ramona, Annabelle, and Mercedes are arrested, but, only Destiny (thinking of her daughter) takes a plea deal.

The film is loosely based on the 1959 novel King\\'s Ransom by Ed McBain (Evan Hunter).\\n\\nPlot: A wealthy executive named Kingo Gondo (Toshiro Mifune) is in a struggle to gain control of a company called National Shoes. One faction wants the company to make cheap, low quality shoes for the impulse market as opposed to the sturdy and high quality shoes currently being produced. Gondo believes that the long-term future of the company will be best served by well-made shoes with modern styling, though this plan is unpopular because it means lower profits in the short term. He has secretly set up a leveraged buyout to gain control of the company, mortgaging all he has.\\nJust as he is about to put his plan into action, he receives a phone call from someone claiming to have kidnapped his son, Jun. Gondo is prepared to pay the ransom, but the call is dismissed as a prank when Jun comes in from playing outside. However, Jun\\'s playmate, Shinichi, the child of Gondo\\'s chauffeur, is missing and the kidnappers have mistakenly abducted him instead.\\nIn another phone call the kidnapper reveals that he has discovered his mistake but still demands the same ransom. Gondo is now forced to make a decision about whether to pay the ransom to save the child or complete the buyout. After a long night of contemplation Gondo announces that he will not pay the ransom, explaining that doing so would not only mean the loss of his position in the company, but cause him to go into debt and throw the futures of his wife and son into jeopardy. His plans are weakened when his top aide lets the \"cheap shoes\" faction know about the kidnapping in return for a promotion should they take over. Finally, after continuous pleading from the chauffeur and under pressure from his wife, Gondo decides to pay the ransom. Following the kidnapper\\'s instructions, the money is put into two small briefcases and thrown out from a moving train; Shinichi is found unharmed.\\nGondo is forced out of the company and his creditors demand the collateral in lieu of debt. The story is widely reported however, making Gondo a hero, while the National Shoe Company is vilified and boycotted. Meanwhile, the police eventually find the hideout where Shinichi was kept prisoner. The bodies of the kidnapper\\'s two accomplices are found there, killed by an overdose of heroin. The police surmise that the kidnapper engineered their deaths by supplying them with uncut drugs. Further clues lead to the identity of the kidnapper, a medical intern at a nearby hospital, but there is no hard evidence linking him to the accomplices\\' murders.\\nThe police lay a trap by first planting a false story in the newspapers implying that the accomplices are still alive, and then forging a note from them demanding more drugs. The kidnapper is then apprehended in the act of trying to supply another lethal dose of uncut heroin to his accomplices, after testing the strength on a drug addict who overdoses and dies. Most of the ransom money is recovered, but too late to save Gondo\\'s property from auction. With the kidnapper facing a death sentence, he requests to see Gondo while in prison and Gondo finally meets him face to face. Gondo has gone to work for a rival shoe company, earning less money but enjoying a free hand in running it. The kidnapper at first feigns no regrets for his actions. As he reveals that envy from seeing Gondo\\'s house on the hill every day led him to conceive of the crime, his emotions gradually gain control over him and he ends up breaking down emotionally before Gondo after finally facing his failure.\\n'},\n",

It was Kurosawa's second film of 1949 produced by the Film Art Association and released by Shintoho. It is also considered a detective movie (among the earliest Japanese films in that genre)[2] that explores the mood of Japan during its painful postwar recovery. The film is also considered a precursor to the contemporary police procedural and buddy cop film genres, based on its premise of pairing two cops with different personalities and motivations together on a difficult case.[3]\\n\\nPlot: The film takes place during a heatwave in the middle of summer in post-war Tokyo. Murakami (Toshiro Mifune), a newly-promoted homicide detective in the Tokyo police, has his Colt pistol stolen while riding on a crowded trolley. He chases the pickpocket, but loses him. A remorseful Murakami reports the theft to his superior, Nakajima, at police headquarters. After Nakajima encourages him to conduct an investigation into the theft, the inexperienced Murakami gets a lead from one of the ladies who traveled in the trolley and goes undercover in the city's backstreets for days, trying to infiltrate the illicit arms market. He eventually locates a dealer who agrees to sell him a stolen gun, but when Murakami arrests the dealer's girlfriend at the exchange, he is distraught to find that she doesn't know anything about his missing gun.  \\nWith the aid of a self-missed test fired bullet retrieved in a tree trunk by Murakami, Tokyo police forensic firearms expert determines that Murakami's Colt was used to mug a woman of ¥40,000. Nakajima partners him up with Tokyo police's veteran detective Satō (Takashi Shimura). After Satō skillfully questions the girlfriend, the two detectives learn that the dealer, who is using the alias of 'Honda', is a fan of baseball. They stake-out a local high-attendance baseball game looking for Honda and manage to lure him away from the crowd before taking him into custody. A rice ration card found on his person reveals that the gun was loaned to Yusa, a disenchanted war veteran who has become involved with the yakuza to support himself. The detectives interview Yusa's sister, one of his yakuza associates, and his sweetheart, showgirl Harumi Namiki (Keiko Awaji); but none of these visits produce any useful leads.\\nMurakami's gun is used again, this time to murder another woman during a robbery. He and Satō continue to question Namiki at her mother's house. She is still reluctant to talk, so Satō leaves to trace Yusa's movements, while Murakami remains behind hoping that Namiki's mother can persuade her to begin cooperating. Satō finds the hotel where Yusa is staying. He tries to call Murakami, but just as he is about to reveal Yusa's location, the criminal (having overheard the hotel owners mention that a cop is present) shoots Satō twice before making his escape. Satō, badly wounded but alive, staggers out the door, passes out from blood loss, and is taken to the hospital. A distraught Murakami is forcibly removed from the hospital on Nakajima's orders when he becomes disruptive and starts wailing loudly. \\nThe following morning, Namiki has a change of heart and informs Murakami that Yusa called and asked her to meet him at a train station so they can skip town. Murakami races to the station and manages to get a positive identification on Yusa by taking into account his age, white suit stained with mud, and left-handedness, three tips he has collected over the past few days. Yusa tries to flee and Murakami pursues him into the forest; Yusa is able to wound him in the arm, but then panics, wastes his last two bullets, and throws the gun away. Murakami, in spite of his injury, wrestles Yusa down, handcuffs him, retrieves the gun, and takes him into custody. Days later at the hospital, Satō has recovered and congratulates Murakami on receiving his first citation. Murakami admits that he sympathizes with Yusa's situation, to which Satō replies that he will lose such sentimentality as he arrests more people and that he should focus on getting ready for the cases that he will need to solve in the future.\\n\"},\n",

On his 21st birthday, Tim learns from his father that the men of his family have the ability to travel back in time to moments they have lived before. James discourages his son from using his gift to acquire money or fame, and Tim decides he will use it to improve his love life.\\nThe following summer, Kit Kat\\'s friend Charlotte visits. Tim is instantly smitten, but waits until the end of her stay to tell her how he feels; she tells him that he should have told her earlier. Tim travels back in time to tell Charlotte in the middle of the holiday, but she advises him to wait until her last day. Heartbroken, Tim realises she is uninterested in him, and that time travel cannot change anyone\\'s mind. Believing he has lost true love, Tim becomes jaded.\\nTim moves to London to pursue a career as a lawyer, living with his father\\'s acquaintance, Harry, an angry misanthropic playwright. Tim visits a Dans le Noir restaurant, where he meets Mary, an American immigrant and book publisher. They flirt in the darkness, and afterward, Mary gives Tim her phone number. Tim returns home to find a distraught Harry, whose opening night of his new play has been ruined by an actor forgetting his lines. Tim goes back in time to help the actor, and the play is a triumph.\\nHowever, when Tim tries to call Mary, he discovers that by going back in time to help Harry, the evening with Mary never occurred. He recalls Mary\\'s obsession with Kate Moss and finds Mary a week later at a Kate Moss exhibition. However, he discovers that she now has a boyfriend. Tim goes back in time having discovered when and where they met, turning up early before the potential boyfriend arrives, and persuades Mary to leave with him instead. Their relationship develops and Tim moves in with Mary. One night, he encounters Charlotte who now seems interested in him, something Tim initially seems to consider, but turns her down upon the invitation of intimacy, realising that he is in love with Mary. He proposes; they marry and have a daughter, Posy.\\nKit Kat\\'s relationship and employment struggles lead her to drunkenly crash her car on Posy\\'s first birthday. As Kit Kat recovers, Tim decides to intervene in her life: he prevents the crash and takes Kit Kat back in time to avert her unhappy relationship with Jimmy. They manage to return to the present, where Tim finds Posy has never been born and he has a son instead. James explains that they cannot change events prior to their children\\'s birth and ensure that that exact child will still be conceived. Tim accepts that he cannot change his sister\\'s life by changing her past; he allows the crash to occur, ensuring Posy\\'s birth, and he and Mary help Kit Kat face her problems to improve her own life. She settles down with Tim\\'s friend Jay and has a child of her own. Tim and Mary have another child, a baby boy, ensuring Kit Kat\\'s future.\\nTim learns his father has terminal lung cancer and that time travel cannot change it, as going back to remove his habitual smoking would undo his and Kit Kat\\'s conception. His father has known for some time, traveling back in time to effectively extend his life and spend more time with his family. He tells Tim to live each day twice in order to be truly happy: first, with all the everyday tensions and worries, but the second time noticing how sweet the world can be. Tim follows this advice; his father dies, but Tim travels to the past to visit whenever he misses him.\\nMary tells Tim she wants a third child. He is reluctant because it means he will not be able to visit his father again. Tim tells his father that he cannot visit anymore, and together they travel back to relive a fond memory from Tim\\'s early childhood, taking care not to actually change the experience to avoid causing any changes to the present. Mary gives birth to a baby girl, and Tim knows he can never see his father again. Tim comes to realise that it is better to live each day once, deciding from that point on to not time travel at all, and comes to appreciate life with his family as if he is living it for the second time.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'Harakiri (切腹, Seppuku[2], 1962) is a 1962 Japanese jidaigeki film directed by Masaki Kobayashi. The story takes place between 1619 and 1630 during the Edo period and the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate. It tells the story of the rōnin Hanshirō Tsugumo,[3] who requests to commit seppuku (harakiri) within the manor of a local feudal lord, using the opportunity to explain the events that drove him to ask for death before an audience of samurai. The film continues to receive critical acclaim, often considered one of the best samurai pictures ever made.\\n\\nPlot: The film takes place in Edo in the year 1630. A rōnin called Tsugumo Hanshirō arrives at the estate of the Iyi Clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him, Saitō Kageyu, the daimyō\\'s senior counselor, tells Hanshirō the story of another rōnin, Chijiiwa Motome—formerly of the same clan as Hanshirō.\\nSaitō scornfully recalls the practice of rōnin requesting the chance to commit seppuku on the clan\\'s land, but in fact  hoping to be turned away and given alms. Motome had arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as Hanshirō. Infuriated by the rising number of \"suicide bluffs\", the three most senior samurai of the clan—Yazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuro—persuaded Saitō to force Motome to follow through and kill himself, ignoring his request for a couple of days delay. Upon examining Motome\\'s swords, his blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \"pawn his soul\", the House of Iyi forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating.\\nDespite this warning, Hanshirō insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he is sincere in wanting to commit seppuku. Just as the ceremony is about to begin, Hanshirō is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of Saitō and the Iyi retainers, Hanshirō successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro — the three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, with each claiming to be too ill to attend.\\nWhile waiting for the messengers to return, Hanshirō recounts his life story to the assembled samurai, starting with the admission that he did know Motome. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shōgun. His lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, Hanshirō planned to die alongside him. To prevent this, Hanshirō\\'s closest friend took his place instead, leaving Hanshirō responsible for his teenage son, Motome. In order to support Motome and his own daughter Miho, Hanshirō rented a hovel in the slums of Edo, taking up work as a fan and umbrella craftsman while Motome became a teacher. Realizing the love between Motome and Miho, Hanshirō arranged for them to marry. Soon after, they had a son, Kingo.\\nWhen Miho became ill with tuberculosis, Motome could not bear the thought of losing her and did everything to raise money to hire a doctor. When Kingo also fell ill, Motome left one morning, saying he planned to take out a loan from a moneylender. Later that evening, Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro brought home Motome\\'s mutilated body, and described and mocked his death before leaving. It is now clear that Motome had requested a delay so he could visit his family and put his affairs in order. A few days later, Kingo died, and Miho lost the will to live and died, leaving Hanshirō with nothing. Finishing his story, Hanshirō explains that his sole desire is to join Motome, Miho, and Kingo in death. He explains, however, that they have every right to ask him whether justice has been exacted for their deaths. Therefore, Hanshirō asks Saitō if he has any statement of regret to convey to Motome, Miho, and Kingo. He explains that, if Saitō does so, he will die without saying another word. Saitō refuses, calling Motome an \"extortionist\" who deserved to die.\\nAfter provoking Saitō\\'s laughter by calling the samurai moral code bushido a facade, Hanshirō reveals the last part of his story. Before coming to the Iyi estate, he tracked down Hayato and Umenosuke and cut off their topknots. Hikokuro then visited Hanshirō\\'s hovel and, with great respect, challenged him to a duel. After a brief but tense sword fight, Hikokuro suffers a double disgrace: his sword is broken and his topknot is taken as well. As proof, Hanshirō removes their labelled topknots from his kimono and casts them upon the palace courtyard. He mocks the Iyi clan, saying that if the men he humiliated were true samurai, they would not be hiding out of shame. He also questions the clan\\'s honor and bushido itself, pointing out that they should not have ignored Motome’s request for a delay to his seppuku without investigating the reason why he asked, but they were too preoccupied with their supposed honor to care.\\nHaving badly lost face, an enraged Saitō calls Hanshirō a madman and orders the retainers to kill him. In a fierce battle, Hanshirō kills four samurai, wounds eight, and contemptuously smashes into pieces the antique suit of armor which symbolizes the glorious history of the House of Iyi. Finally, the clan corners Hanshirō and prepares to kill him not with swords, but with three matchlock guns. As Hanshirō commits seppuku, he is simultaneously shot by all three gunmen.\\nTerrified that the Iyi clan will be abolished if word gets out that \"a half starved rōnin\" killed so many of their retainers, Saitō announces that all deaths caused by Hanshirō shall be explained by \"illness\". At the same time, a messenger returns reporting that Hikokuro had killed himself the day before, while Hayato and Umenosuke are both faking illness. Saitō angrily orders that Hayato and Umenosuke are to be forced to commit seppuku as atonement for losing their topknots. Those three deaths shall be also attributed to “illness”.\\nAs the suit of armor is cleaned and re-erected, a new entry in the official records of the House of Iyi is read by a voiceover. Hanshirō is declared to have been mentally unstable, and he and Motome are both listed as having died through harakiri. The Shōgun is said to have issued a personal commendation to the lord of the Iyi clan for how his councilors handled the suicide bluffs of Motome and Hanshirō. At the end of his letter, the Shōgun praises the House of Iyi and their samurai as exemplars of bushido. As workers scrub the blood from the ground of the clan\\'s estate, one of them finds a severed topknot and places it in his work bucket.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'Exit Through the Gift Shop is a 2010 British documentary film directed by street artist Banksy. It tells the story of Thierry Guetta, a French immigrant in Los Angeles who, over the course of several years, filmed a host of street artists at work, including Shepard Fairey and Banksy, but failed to do anything with the footage. Eventually, Banksy decided to use the footage to make a documentary, which includes new footage depicting Guetta\\'s rise to fame as the artist \"Mr. Brainwash\". In addition to narration read by Rhys Ifans, the story is largely related by Banksy himself, whose face is obscured and voice altered to preserve his anonymity. Geoff Barrow composed the film\\'s score, and Richard Hawley\\'s \"Tonight The Streets Are Ours\" plays during the opening and closing credits.[1] The film premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival on 24 January 2010, and it was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 83rd Academy Awards.\\nSince its release, there has been extensive debate over whether the film is a genuine documentary or a mockumentary. When asked if the film is real, Banksy simply replied: \"Yes.\"[2]\\n\\nPlot: Thierry Guetta is a French immigrant living in Los Angeles, who runs a successful upscale vintage clothing shop and obsessively films his life. While visiting France in 1999, Guetta discovers his cousin is famed street artist Invader. Fascinated, he accompanies Invader and his friends, who include Monsieur André and Zevs, on their nocturnal adventures, documenting everything.\\nA few months later, Invader visits Guetta in LA and arranges a meeting with Shepard Fairey. Guetta continues to film Fairey after Invader returns to France, and when Fairey asks what Guetta plans to do with the footage, Guetta says he is going to make a documentary about street art. He follows Fairey as Fairey travels the world executing the OBEY Giant campaign, and films numerous artists at work, among them Poster Boy, Seizer, Neck Face, Sweet Toof, Cyclops, Ron English, Dotmasters, Swoon, Azil, Borf, and Buff Monster. However, in reality, Guetta merely likes to film things and has no intention of making a film out of the footage, which he never watches, simply dumping the tapes into boxes.\\nGuetta becomes obsessed with filming the mysterious Banksy, but can\\'t arrange an introduction. Then, in the spring of 2006, Banksy\\'s visit to LA is complicated when his usual accomplice is turned back at the border control, so he contacts Fairey, who recommends that Guetta would make a good guide. Things go well, and Banksy invites Guetta to England to film the production and deployment of his \"Murdered Phone Booth\" piece, including the crowd reaction. This confuses Banksy\\'s crew, who are used to secrecy, but Banksy sees value in documenting street art, which he admits typically has a \"short lifespan\". After Guetta returns home, he begins to put up his own stickers and posters.\\nWhen Banksy is back in LA preparing for his \"Barely Legal\" show, he takes Guetta to Disneyland to film the reaction after he deploys an inflatable doll dressed like a Guantanamo Bay detainee there. Guetta is caught and interrogated by security, but is able to stash the videotape in his sock and delete his still photographs, so he is released after four hours. Following this, Banksy admits he began to trust Guetta implicitly.\\n\"Barely Legal\" is a huge success, and the price of street art begins to skyrocket in auction houses. Banksy is stunned by the sudden hype and urges Guetta to finish his documentary to show what the movement is really about. Over the next six months, Guetta turns his several thousand hours of footage into a film titled Life Remote Control: an unfocused 90\\xa0minutes of disorienting fast cutting. Banksy deems it \"unwatchable\", but feels that the street art footage itself is valuable, and decides to try and produce a film himself; to distract Guetta, he suggests him to go home, make some art, and put on a show.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'Watchmen is a 2009 American superhero film based on the 1986–1987 DC Comics limited series of the same name co-created and illustrated by Dave Gibbons (with co-creator and author Alan Moore choosing to remain uncredited).[11] Directed by Zack Snyder from a screenplay by David Hayter and Alex Tse, the film features Malin Åkerman, Billy Crudup, Matthew Goode, Carla Gugino, Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Patrick Wilson. A dark and dystopian deconstruction of the superhero genre, the film is set in an alternate history in the year 1985 at the height of the Cold War, as a group of mostly retired American superheroes investigate the murder of one of their own before uncovering an elaborate and deadly conspiracy, while their moral limitations are challenged by the complex nature of the circumstances.\\nFor nearly two decades from October 1987 until October 2005, a live-action film adaptation of the Watchmen series became stranded in development hell. Producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver began developing the project at 20th Century Fox, later moving it to Warner Bros. Pictures, the sister company of Watchmen publisher DC Comics, and hiring director Terry Gilliam, who eventually left the production and deemed the complex comic \"unfilmable\". During the 2000s, Gordon and Lloyd Levin collaborated with Universal Pictures, Revolution Studios and Paramount Pictures to produce the film. Directors David Hayter, Darren Aronofsky and Paul Greengrass were attached to the project before it was cancelled over budget disputes. In October 2005, the project returned to Warner Bros., where Snyder was hired to direct. Paramount remained as its international distributor, whereas Warner Bros. would distribute the film in the United States. However, Fox sued Warner Bros. for copyright violation arising from Gordon\\'s failure to pay a buy-out in 1991, which enabled him to develop the film at the other studios. Fox and Warner Bros. settled this before the film\\'s release, with Fox receiving a portion of the gross. Principal photography began in Vancouver, in September 2007. As with his previous film 300 (2006), Snyder closely modelled his storyboards on the comic, but chose not to shoot all of Watchmen using green screens and opted for real sets instead.\\nFollowing its world premiere at Odeon Leicester Square on February 23, 2009,[12] the film was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters on March 6, 2009. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing over $185 million worldwide against a production budget between $130–138 million. The film polarized fans and critics; the style was praised, but Snyder was accused of making an action film that lacked the thematic depth and nuance of the comic.[13] A DVD based on elements of the Watchmen universe was released, including an animated adaptation of the Tales of the Black Freighter comic within the story voiced by Gerard Butler, and a fictional documentary titled Under the Hood, detailing the older generation of superheroes from the film\\'s back-story.[14] A director\\'s cut with 24 minutes of additional footage was released in July 2009. The \"Ultimate Cut\" edition incorporated the animated comic Tales of the Black Freighter into the narrative as it was in the original graphic novel, lengthening the runtime to 3 hours and 35 minutes, and was released on November 3, 2009. The director\\'s cut was better received than the theatrical release.[13]\\n\\nPlot: In 1985, a man living in a Manhattan apartment watches news about escalating Cold War tensions and the response from five-term President Richard Nixon, when an unseen assailant attacks and hurls him to the street below. Intersped throughout the opening credits is a montage that reviews the rise of costumed crime-fighters from 1939 to 1977, culminating in public backlash and the passage of an anti-vigilante act. \\nRorschach, a vigilante detective who operates illegally, discovers that the dead man was Edward Blake, better known as \"The Comedian\", a costumed hero who worked for the government. Suspecting that other vigilantes could be attacked, Rorschach warns members of his former team, the Watchmen.[15] Rorschach\\'s former partner Dan Dreiberg believes he is paranoid but relays his concerns to Adrian Veidt, a crime-fighter turned businessman. Rorschach later visits Doctor Manhattan, a physicist whose accidental superpowers make him a national security asset, but Manhattan is preoccupied with energy research and ignores him.\\nAt Blake\\'s funeral, Osterman, Veidt and Dreiberg each recall the Comedian\\'s pessimism in his later years about the Watchmen\\'s mission. After the service, a lone mourner pays his respects. Rorschach tracks down and questions the mourner, former supervillain Edgar Jacobi. Jacobi says that Blake had recently broken into his apartment while he was sleeping — tearful, unmasked and incoherent. Rorschach is astonished, but doubts that Jacobi would tell a lie so bizarre. During a press interview with Doctor Manhattan, an investigative journalist tells him that several people who had been in contact with Manhattan have developed cancer, including his former girlfriend. As other reporters mob Manhattan with questions, he snaps and exiles himself to Mars. Alone, Manhattan reflects on his existence and regrets at being turned into a weapon. In his absence, the Warsaw Pact countries make aggressive moves and Nixon prepares for war.\\nVeidt survives an assassination attempt, suggesting that Rorschach\\'s \"mask-killer\" theory is correct. Dreiberg takes in Laurie Jupiter, a second-generation vigilante and estranged friend of Manhattan, for protection. Rorschach\\'s investigation of the assassin leads him back to Jacobi. While attempting to question him again, Rorschach is framed for his murder, arrested, and unmasked as a low-born vagrant. In prison, Rorschach defends his vigilantism to a psychiatrist, saying that he cannot ignore evil and the people who cause it. Dreiberg and Jupiter, growing nostalgic for their crime-fighting days, put on their costumes and break Rorschach out of prison. Manhattan teleports Jupiter to Mars while Dreiberg joins Rorschach\\'s investigation of the Blake murder. Evidence points them to Veidt as the mastermind; they find him at an Antarctic hideout, where he has just overseen activation of Osterman\\'s energy reactors in New York City and other locations across the planet. On Mars, Jupiter tries to convince Manhattan that humanity is worth saving, and succeeds only when he learns that Jupiter is Blake\\'s illegitimate daughter, a fact so unlikely that it restores his respect for life.\\nVeidt admits orchestrating Manhattan\\'s exile, staging the assassination, framing Rorschach, and killing Blake who was spying on his activities. He has also executed the final step of his plan: Turning the world against Manhattan by rigging his reactors to explode, killing 15 million people. Manhattan returns with Jupiter to a devastated New York, pieces together what has happened and teleports to Veidt\\'s hideout. After a brief struggle, Veidt shows him that the countries of the world have put aside their rivalries to focus on a common enemy. Realizing the logic of Veidt\\'s plan, the Watchmen agree to keep his secret, with the exception of Rorschach, whom Manhattan reluctantly kills to preserve the new global peace. Manhattan departs permanently for another galaxy while Dreiberg rebukes Veidt\\'s moral sacrifice, and Jupiter finally comes to terms with her parentage. Meanwhile, a New York tabloid editor, disgusted that there is no war to report on, tells a fellow journalist to grab something from a box of crank submissions that contains Rorschach\\'s journal.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'The Producers is a 1967 American satirical black comedy film written and directed by Mel Brooks and starring Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, Dick Shawn, and Kenneth Mars. The film is about a theater producer and his accountant who scheme to get rich by fraudulently overselling interests in a stage musical purposely designed to fail. They find a script celebrating Adolf Hitler and the Nazis and bring it to the stage. Because of this theme, The Producers was controversial from the start[8][9] and received mixed reviews. It became a cult film[10] and found a more positive critical reception later.\\nThe Producers was Brooks\\'s directorial debut.[11] For the film, he won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"[12] and placed eleventh on the AFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Laughs list. It was later adapted by Brooks and Thomas Meehan as a stage musical, which itself was adapted into a film.\\n\\nPlot: Max Bialystock is an aging Broadway producer whose career has veered from great success to the depths of near failure. He now ekes out a hand-to-mouth existence romancing lascivious, wealthy elderly women in exchange for money for a \"next play\" that may never be produced. Accountant Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom, a nervous young man prone to hysterics, arrives at Max\\'s office to audit his accounts and discovers a $2,000 discrepancy in the accounts of Max\\'s last play. Max persuades Leo to hide the relatively minor fraud, and while shuffling numbers, Leo realizes that, as a flop is expected to lose money, the IRS will not investigate its finances, so a producer could oversell shares in the production and not have to repay investors. For this same reason, no duped investor will be aware of the many others, thus protecting the pair from charges of fraud. Max instantly puts this scheme into action. They will oversell shares on a massive scale and produce a play that will close on opening night, thus avoiding payouts and leaving the duo free to flee to Rio de Janeiro with the profits. Leo is afraid such a criminal venture will fail and they will go to prison, but Max convinces him that his current drab existence is no better than prison.\\nThe partners find the ideal play for their scheme: Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden. It is \"a love letter to Hitler\" written in total sincerity by deranged ex-Nazi soldier Franz Liebkind. Max and Leo bond with Liebkind over Schnapps, and tell him they want to show the world a positive representation of Hitler. Now with the stage rights, Max sells 25,000% of the play to his regular investors and immediately starts using the money on fixing his office and hiring Ulla, a beautiful Swedish receptionist. To guarantee the show\\'s failure, they hire Roger De Bris, a flamboyant transvestite director whose plays \"close on the first day of rehearsal.\" The part of Hitler goes to a charismatic but barely coherent hippie named Lorenzo Saint DuBois, also known, in a reference to the counterculture drug, as L. S. D., who mistakenly wandered into the theater during the casting call. At the theater on opening night, Max tries to ensure a truly terrible review by attempting to bribe the critic who came to see the show. As expected, the man is outraged and hurls the money Max wrapped around the tickets he gave him at Max\\'s feet.\\nThe play opens with a lavish production of the title song, \"Springtime for Hitler\", which celebrates Nazi Germany conquering Europe (\"Springtime for Hitler and Germany/Winter for Poland and France\"). The audience is horrified and rises en masse after the number, as do Max and Leo. L.S.D. then comes on stage as Hitler, and his beatnik-like portrayal of Hitler reveals that De Bris has altered the script and directed the play as a satire. This enrages and humiliates Franz, who—after dropping the curtain and rushing out on stage—confronts the audience and rants about the treatment of his beloved play. He is knocked out and removed from the stage, and the audience assumes that his rant was part of the act. To Max and Leo\\'s shock and horror, Springtime for Hitler is declared a comic smash hit, which means that the investors will be expecting a larger financial return than can be paid out.\\nA gun-wielding Franz confronts Max and Leo. He tries first to shoot them, and then himself, but runs out of bullets. Max convinces Franz to take out his anger on the cast and crew, but Leo objects to it. The three then decide to blow up the theater to end the production, but they are caught in the explosion and arrested. At the trial, where they are found \"incredibly guilty\" by the jury, Leo makes an impassioned statement praising Max for being his friend and changing his life. Max tells the judge that they have learned their lesson.\\nMax, Leo, and Franz are sent to the state penitentiary and produce and direct a new musical called Prisoners of Love, which they sincerely want to be successful despite low production values. While Max and Franz earnestly supervise rehearsals, Leo continues their old scam—overselling shares of the play to their fellow prisoners, and even to the warden.\\n'},\n",

His collaborator in this plan is Dr. Peter Teleborian, the hospital\\'s administrator, who \"treated\" the young Salander by putting her in restraints for the smallest infractions.\\nBlomkvist persuades her doctor to sneak an Internet phone into Salander\\'s room, whereupon Salander contacts her fellow hacker, Plague, to see if he can find something on Teleborian. She then tells Blomkvist that Annika Giannini, her lawyer and Blomkvist\\'s sister, has permission to use a video showing her state-appointed guardian Nils Bjurman raping her; Bjurman, a former Section employee, is one of the people she is accused of murdering.\\nRonald Niedermann, Zalachenko\\'s son and enforcer who previously tried to kill Salander\\'s girlfriend Miriam, remains a fugitive, wanted for killing a police officer. Sonny, a member of an outlaw motorcycle gang Salander encountered in the previous film, learns that Niedermann went to his home to hide out. There, Sonny finds his brother dead and his girlfriend badly injured. She tells him that Niedermann was the culprit, and Sonny vows revenge.\\nOn the day of her murder trial, Salander enters court with piercings, a mohawk, black makeup, and black leather clothing. Called as an expert witness for the prosecution, Teleborian characterizes Salander as delusional and violent; but Giannini gradually demolishes his credibility, using Salander\\'s words and files from the hospital. She also presents the video proving Bjurman raped Salander.\\nAs Giannini presents her case, the police arrest the people involved with the Section and seize their place of operation. In court, Blomkvist and Giannini prove that Teleborian made a false diagnosis on orders from the Section, and that the evidence against her was planted. Teleborian is then arrested for possession of child pornography, which Plague discovered after hacking into his laptop. The court releases Salander.\\nSalander checks on a property she has inherited from her father and discovers the warehouse where her step-brother Niedermann is hiding. He tries to kill her, but she nails his feet to the floor with a nail gun. She calls Sonny and tells the bikers where to find him, and then calls the police.\\nBlomkvist visits Salander to tell her that the motorcycle gang killed Niedermann and were arrested at the warehouse afterward. They then reconcile and go their separate ways.\\n'},\n",

An international co-production of companies from France, Germany, and Spain, the film is stylistically related to the previous and subsequent Jeunet films, Delicatessen and Amélie.[4]\\nThe musical score was composed by Angelo Badalamenti,[4] with costumes designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier.[5] It was entered into the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.[6]\\n\\nPlot: Krank (Daniel Emilfork), a highly intelligent but malicious being created by a vanished scientist, is unable to dream, which causes him to age prematurely. At his lair on an abandoned oil rig (which he shares with the scientist\\'s other creations: six childish clones, a dwarf named Martha, and a brain in a vat named Irvin) he uses a dream-extracting machine to steal dreams from children. The children are kidnapped for him from a nearby port city by a cyborg cult called the Cyclops, who in exchange he supplies with mechanical eyes and ears. Among the kidnapped is Denree (Joseph Lucien), the adopted little brother of carnival strongman One (Ron Perlman).\\nAfter the carnival manager is stabbed by a mugger, One is hired by a criminal gang of orphans (run by a pair of conjoined twins called \"the Octopus\") to help them steal a safe. The theft is successful, but the safe is lost in the harbor when One is distracted by seeing Denree\\'s kidnappers. He, together with one of the orphans, a little girl called Miette (Judith Vittet), follows the Cyclops and infiltrates their headquarters, but they are captured and sentenced to execution. Meanwhile, the Octopus orders circus performer Marcello (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) to return One to them. He uses his trained fleas, which inject a poison capsule that causes mindless aggression, to turn the Cyclops guards against each other. While Marcello is rescuing One, Miette falls into the harbor and sinks, seemingly drowned, but an amnesiac diver living beneath the harbor rescues her.\\nMiette leaves the diver\\'s lair to find One and Marcello both drowning their sorrows in a bar. Upon seeing Miette alive the remorseful Marcello lets One leave with her. However the Octopus confronts them on the pier, and uses Marcello\\'s stolen fleas to turn One against Miette. A spectacular chain of events triggered by one of Miette\\'s tears leads to a ship crashing into the pier before One can throttle her. Marcello arrives and sets the fleas on the Octopus, allowing One and Miette to escape to continue searching for Denree.\\nBack at Krank\\'s oil rig, Irvin tricks one of the clones into releasing a plea for help in the form of a bottled dream telling the story of what is going on on the oil rig. It reaches One, Miette, and the diver, and the latter remembers that he was the scientist who made them, and that the oil rig was his laboratory before Krank and Martha attacked him and pushed him off it to take it for themselves, leaving him for dead in the water. They all converge on the rig; the diver to destroy it and the duo to rescue Denree.\\nMiette is almost killed by Martha, but the diver harpoons her. She then finds Denree asleep in Krank\\'s dream-extracting machine, and Irvin tells her that to release him she must use the machine to enter the dream herself. In the dream world, she meets Krank and makes a deal with him to replace the boy as the source of the dream; Krank fears a trap but plays along, believing himself to be in control. Miette then uses her imagination to control the dream and turn it into an infinite loop, destroying Krank\\'s mind. One and Miette rescue all the children, while the now-deranged diver loads the rig with dynamite and straps himself to one of its legs. The diver regains his senses as everyone is rowing away and pleads with his remaining creations to come back to rescue him, but a seabird lands on the handle of the blasting machine, blowing up him and the rig.\\n'},\n",

Directed by José Padilha from a screenplay by Padilha, Bráulio Mantovani, and Pimentel, the film stars Wagner Moura, Caio Junqueira, and André Ramiro. In Elite Squad, Roberto Nascimento (Moura), a Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais (BOPE) captain, leads a crackdown on a series of Rio de Janeiro neighbourhoods to prepare for the 1997 state visit of Pope John Paul II. \\nInspired by the Military Police and their related arms, Elite Squad is the second feature and first film by Padilha, after the documentary Bus 174 (2002). \\nElite Squad was an overwhelming critical and commercial success, and became a cultural phenomenon in Brazil. The film won the Golden Bear at the 2008 Berlin Film Festival. Its sequel, Elite Squad: The Enemy Within, released in Brazil on October 8, 2010, holds industry records in the country for ticket sales and gross revenue.\\n\\nPlot: Roberto Nascimento, a BOPE captain, leads an operation to secure the Turano neighbourhood before Pope John Paul II\\'s overnight visit at the Archbishop\\'s home near the favela. With his wife Rosane pregnant, Roberto searches for a successor at the unit before switching to a desk job. \\nRookie PMERJ officers and best friends André Matias and Neto Gouveia handle menial work as instructed to them by their corrupt seniors: Neto supervises the police auto mechanic shop, whilst Matias is responsible for registering and filing police complaints in a small archive office. André also attends law school, where he begins a relationship with Maria, and meets her friends Roberta and Edu; all three are members of a NGO that operates in an area ruled by drug lord Baiano. Baiano provides marijuana to Matias\\' friends, who sell it on campus. André also befriends Romerito, a boy who, like himself, suffers from myopia.\\nNeto applies to another department, but his transfer is denied. Disgusted by corruption and led by fellow officer Fábio, Neto and André steal the police\\'s bribe money to fix as many police cars as possible. Their superior, Captain Oliveira, finds out and demotes them to kitchen work as punishment and orders Fábio—whom he believes stole from him—to meet drug traffickers at a community funk party in Morro da Babilônia to enquire about payment. \\nFábio realizes this is a set-up to kill him and discreetly warns Neto and André, who rush to a vantage point at the party. They use a sniper rifle telescope to watch Oliveira and other policemen but Neto accidentally shoots, causing a deadly gunfight between the officers and traffickers; as André and Neto attempt to flee the scene, Roberto and his men rescue all the officers. After the shootout, André is photographed by the press. André and Neto apply for BOPE, motivated by their honesty and devotion, and eagerness for action. At the NGO office, Baiano confronts Maria and her friends with a newspaper featuring André\\'s picture and threatens to kill them if they bring policemen inside his territory.\\nBOPE training proves to be gruesome, with many candidates quitting the program, including Fábio (who applied as a way to avoid Oliveira), but both Neto and André pass; Neto celebrates by getting a BOPE tattoo on his arm. André\\'s relationship with Maria ends and he confronts Edu, ordering him to arrange a meet with Romerito the next day to give him a pair of glasses. Edu reveals André\\'s plan to Baiano, who sets an ambush to kill him. Neto informs André of a job interview at a law firm that will conflict with meeting Romerito, and volunteers to deliver the glasses in his place: this results in Neto being mortally wounded. When Baiano prepares to execute him, he notices his BOPE tattoo and goes into hiding for fear of retaliation.\\nAfter Neto\\'s funeral, André, Roberto, and the men make daily incursions into Baiano\\'s slum, torturing several dealers into revealing his whereabouts. After one of them reveals Edu tipped Baiano, Matias storms into a peace walk, beats Edu, and insults Maria and the others. BOPE locate and corner Baiano: Roberto orders André to shoot Baiano in the face with a shotgun, as revenge for Neto\\'s death and his final test for BOPE.

The plot follows Shrek who struggles with the responsibilities and stress of being a domesticated family man, yearning for the days he was once feared and lived in solitude. He is tricked by Rumpelstiltskin into signing a contract that leads to disastrous consequences.\\nShrek Forever After premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, 2010, and was theatrically released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on May 21, 2010. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed a worldwide total of $756 million, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2010. It debuted as the top-grossing film at the box office, a position held for three consecutive weeks in the United States and Canada. Two spin-offs, Puss in Boots (2011) and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022), have been released, while a fifth Shrek film is in development.\\n\\nPlot: In a flashback, King Harold and Queen Lillian are about to sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to Rumpelstiltskin (\"Rumpel\") in exchange for lifting the curse of their daughter, Princess Fiona – cursed to transform into an ogre nightly and locked in a tower until rescued by her \"true love\". Before signing, news arrives that she had been saved,[b] and they cancel the deal. In the present, Rumpel has become an outcast and wishes that Fiona\\'s rescuer, Shrek, was never born.\\nMeanwhile, Shrek has grown increasingly tired of being a family man and celebrity, longing for the days when he was feared and had privacy. While celebrating his children\\'s first birthday in Far Far Away, an escalating series of mishaps enrages Shrek, causing him to storm out in anger and lash out at Fiona. Having witnessed the outburst, Rumpel follows Shrek into the forest and stages a scene of being in distress, prompting Shrek to help. Invited inside Rumpel\\'s carriage, Shrek laments that he is no longer a \"real ogre\". Rumpel offers him a deal to receive a day as a \"real ogre\" in exchange for a day from his childhood. Shrek signs a contract fulfilling this wish, and is whisked away into an alternate reality.\\nNow feared by the villagers, Shrek causes some lighthearted mischief, until he discovers that Fiona is a fugitive and his swamp is deserted and desolate. Captured by witches, Shrek is taken to Rumpel, who is now the king of Far Far Away. Rumpel reveals to Shrek that he took the day he was born, meaning Shrek never existed in this altered timeline. Consequently, Harold and Lillian were forced to sign the kingdom over to Rumpel, causing them to disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will cease to exist.\\nShrek escapes Rumpel\\'s castle with Donkey, who is initially terrified of Shrek but befriends him after seeing him cry over his erased history. Donkey helps Shrek find a hidden exit clause; the contract can be nullified by \"true love\\'s kiss\". The pair soon encounter a still-cursed Fiona leading an army of ogres in a resistance against Rumpel, and a lazy and overweight Puss in Boots being kept as Fiona\\'s pet. Shrek unsuccessfully tries to woo Fiona, who has since lost hope of finding true love after not being rescued, and is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel. Puss encourages Shrek to continue pursuing Fiona.\\nDuring the ambush, most of the ogres are captured by the Pied Piper, who was hired by Rumpel, but Shrek and Fiona escape with Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists that Fiona kiss him, assuring her that it will fix everything; she reluctantly obliges, but to Shrek\\'s surprise, nothing happens. Later on, Rumpel publicly offers a wish to anyone who brings him Shrek, and after hearing this, Shrek turns himself in. Rumpel is forced to grant Shrek\\'s wish, and he uses it to free the other ogres. As Shrek is locked up, Rumpel reveals that Fiona had been captured and not released, since she is not \"all ogre\". Donkey, Puss, and the freed ogres storm the castle; they capture Rumpel and defeat his witch army, while Shrek and Fiona take down Dragon.\\nAs the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses him just before he disappears. Seeing that she is still an ogre in the sunlight, Fiona realizes that her curse was broken and that she has assumed \"love\\'s true form\". The alternate reality disintegrates, making everyone disappear, and Shrek finds himself transported back to the original timeline at the moment before he lost his temper at the party. Instead of lashing out, Shrek embraces his family and friends with a newfound appreciation for them.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': \"March of the Penguins (French La Marche de l'empereur\\xa0; French pronunciation:\\xa0\\u200b[lamaʁʃ dəlɑ̃ˈpʁœʁ]) is a 2005 French feature-length nature documentary directed and co-written by Luc Jacquet, and co-produced by Bonne Pioche[4] and the National Geographic Society. The documentary depicts the yearly journey of the emperor penguins of Antarctica. In autumn, all the penguins of breeding age (five years old and over) leave the ocean, which is their normal habitat, to walk inland to their ancestral breeding grounds. There, the penguins participate in a courtship that, if successful, results in the hatching of a chick. For the chick to survive, both parents must make multiple arduous journeys between the ocean and the breeding grounds over the ensuing months.\\nIt took one year for the two isolated cinematographers Laurent Chalet and Jérôme Maison to shoot the documentary, which was shot around the French scientific base of Dumont d'Urville in Adélie Land.\\nMarch of the Penguins was released in France on 26 January 2005 by Buena Vista International and in the United States by Warner Independent Pictures on 24 June 2005. The documentary won the 2006 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature.[5] On 1 June 2010, a home video release in France included the movie in the Disneynature collection. A direct sequel titled March of the Penguins 2: The Next Step (aka March of the Penguins 2: The Call) was released in France in 2017 by Disneynature. It was released in the United States exclusively on Hulu on 23 March 2018. It is named as one of the most successful documentaries in North America and France.[6]\\n\\nPlot: The emperor penguins use a particular spot as their breeding ground because it is on ice that is solid year round with no danger of the ice becoming too soft to support the colony that exists. At the end of Antarctic summer, the breeding ground is only a few hundred meters away from the open water where the penguins can feed. However, by the end of winter, the breeding ground is over 100 kilometres (62\\xa0mi) away from the nearest open water. To reach it, all the penguins of breeding age must traverse this great distance.\\nThe penguins practice serial monogamy within each breeding season. The female lays a single egg, and the co-operation of the parents is needed if the chick is to survive. After the female lays the egg, she transfers it to the feet of the waiting male with minimal exposure to the elements, as the intense cold could kill the developing embryo. The male tends to the egg when the female returns to the sea, now even farther away, both to feed herself and to obtain extra food for feeding her chick when she returns. The male  has not eaten in two months and by the time the female leaves the hatching area, she will have lost a third of her body weight producing the egg.\\nFor an additional two months, the males huddle together for warmth, and incubate their eggs. They endure temperatures approaching −62\\xa0°C (−80\\xa0°F), and their only source of water is snow that falls on the breeding ground. When the chicks hatch, the males have only a small meal to feed them, and if the female does not return, they must abandon their chick and return to the sea to feed themselves. By the time they return, the males have lost half their weight and have not eaten for four months. The chicks are also at risk from predatory birds such as northern giant petrels.[7]\\nThe mother penguins come back and feed their young, while the male penguins go all the way back to sea (70\\xa0miles) to feed themselves. This gives the mothers time to feed their young ones and bond with them. Unfortunately, a fierce storm arrives and some of the chicks perish.\\nThe death of a chick is tragic, but it does allow the parents to return to the sea to feed for the rest of the breeding season. When a mother penguin loses its young in a fierce storm, it sometimes attempts to steal another mother's chick. When the other parent returns, it can recognize the chick only from its unique call. Many parents die on the trip, killed by exhaustion or by predators (such as the leopard seal), dooming their chicks back at the breeding ground.\\nThe ingenious fight against starvation is a recurring theme throughout the documentary. In one scene, near-starving chicks are shown taking sustenance out of their father's throat sacs, 11th-hour nourishment in the form of a milky, protein-rich substance secreted from a sac in the father's throat to feed their chicks in the event that circumstances require.\\nThe parents must then tend to the chick for an additional four months, shuttling back and forth to the sea to provide food for their young. As spring progresses, the trip gets progressively easier as the ice melts and the distance to the sea decreases, until finally the parents can leave the chicks to fend for themselves.\\n\"},\n",

It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is embroiled in a catastrophic blight and famine, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humankind.\\nBrothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007. Kip Thorne, a Caltech theoretical physicist and 2017 Nobel laureate in Physics,[4] was an executive producer, acted as a scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, The Science of Interstellar. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm movie film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70\\xa0mm.

He deduces it to be a pattern of GPS coordinates and arrives at a secret NASA facility headed by Professor Brand. Brand explains to Cooper that they are trying to find an exoplanet capable of supporting life, and that he is working on solving a gravity equation to provide a way of transporting large numbers of people off the Earth. He enlists Cooper to pilot an exploratory spacecraft called the Endurance, equipped with two Ranger craft and one Lander craft, with a crew of three scientists: Romilly, Doyle, and Brand’s daughter Amelia. This is humanity's last chance; there are no more resources to mount another expedition. A wormhole has been found near Saturn, enabling the ship to pass through into another galaxy to search for a new home.\\nOn the other side, they investigate three planets orbiting a supermassive black hole, Gargantua, with each one previously being checked by a NASA scientist-explorer. Romilly remains in orbit to study Gargantua while the others take a Ranger craft to the surface. The first planet is an ocean world of shallow water. Upon arriving at the beacon and finding debris, they realize the explorer Miller is dead, and Doyle gets swept away by a tidal wave generated by Gargantua's gravity. The wave also floods the Ranger's engines, but they dry out in time for liftoff before the craft would have been destroyed. They return to the Endurance after only one hour, but 23 years have passed due to the time dilation caused by Gargantua's gravity. Back on Earth, Murph has become a scientist and begun working with Brand.\\nOn the second planet, the crew awaken the explorer Mann from cryostasis. He reveals to Cooper that he lied about the planet's habitability in the hope that someone would come to rescue him. Back on Earth, a dying Brand confesses to Murph that he lied about being close to a solution for the gravity equation. He put his hopes on Cooper's team finding a habitable planet and establishing a new colony using pre-fertilized eggs. Meanwhile, Romilly dies in an explosion at Mann's camp when he attempts to access the system logs of a robot booby trapped by Mann. Mann tries to kill Cooper, escapes by stealing a Ranger and attempts to hijack the Endurance. Mann then gets himself blown up when he disregards and overrides safety warnings after failing to properly dock the Ranger. After seeing the explosion, Cooper and Brand approach in the Lander and they manage to regain control of the heavily damaged spacecraft.\\nWhile all hope seems lost, Cooper comes up with a plan to use the remaining Ranger and Lander crafts to execute a fuel burn, to gain the required speed needed to initiate a slingshot maneuver around Gargantua, to propel the damaged Endurance onwards to the third and final planet. However, he has to sacrifice himself by detaching and falling into the black hole to enable Brand to reach Edmunds' planet.\\nInstead of being spagettified, Cooper finds himself inside a five-dimensional tesseract, out of view from beyond the event horizon. From inside he can see moments in time from inside Murph's childhood bedroom. He finds her returning to look for clues to the gravity equation, and he contacts her by manipulating items in the room with gravity to communicate through Morse code. Deducing that this construct has been created by future humans with the ability to time-travel, Cooper imparts to her the information she needs to solve the equation. The future beings return him near Saturn where he gets rescued. He is reunited with an elderly Murph, who has used the gravity equation to enable humanity's exodus from Earth. Feeling content with her life and knowing Cooper kept his word that he would come back to her, she advises him to seek out Amelia and spends the remaining moments with her family. Cooper follows Murph's advice and he sets off again to reunite with Amelia. On the final planet, Amelia removes her helmet and breathes, revealing the planet is capable of sustaining life.\\n\"},\n",

Dollface wakes a sleeping female occupant by knocking at the front door. When she investigates, she sees Dollface already in the house, who kills her offscreen and then lies down in bed next to the woman\\'s sleeping husband.\\nSometime later, Mike and his wife Cindy take a trip with their children, Luke and Kinsey, to their aunt and uncle\\'s trailer park to spend time together before Kinsey leaves for boarding school. After arriving, an unmasked Dollface knocks at their front door and asks for Tamara, but is turned away by Cindy. Kinsey and Luke go for a walk and stumble upon a trailer with the door open.

They find the cell phones smashed to pieces before Dollface appears and kills Cindy. Kinsey escapes through the trailer roof. Mike and Luke find the voicemail that Cindy left for their uncle in the trailer, realizing that the offenders were waiting for them to arrive. After fending off the Man in the Mask with a gun, they head back to the family trailer, where they find Cindy dead.

They instead go into another trailer and bandage up Kinsey\\'s wounds, before the Man in the Mask drives his truck into the trailer. They escape and Luke hides Kinsey under a porch for safety. When he runs to the general store to call for help, Luke realizes he\\'s not alone and escapes out to the swimming pool, where he overpowers and kills Pin-Up Girl.

Kinsey is able to seize the Deputy\\'s shotgun and shoot Dollface, incapacitating her. Kinsey removes Dollface\\'s mask and asks her why she is doing this, to which she simply replies, \"Why not?\". Kinsey then executes Dollface with the shotgun. The Man in the Mask arrives in the truck and totals the police SUV to prevent Kinsey from escaping. She uses her cigarette lighter to ignite a gasoline leak from both trucks, blowing them both up. The Man in the Mask, however, survives the explosion and continues pursuing her in his truck engulfed in flames. He exits in an effort to kill Kinsey with the axe, but is overcome by his injuries and falls to the ground. Kinsey flags down a passing truck for help, but they attempt to flee when they see the Man in the Mask appear, still alive, behind Kinsey. She climbs into the back-end with him in pursuit, but manages to knock him off of the truck by bashing him in the head with a baseball bat, finally killing him.\\nSome time later, Kinsey is at a hospital with Luke recovering from his injuries. As Kinsey awakens from a nightmare, she hears the jack-in-the-box toy noise she heard earlier when encountering Dollface, along with a knock at the door.\\n'},\n",

It stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as American astronauts who attempt to return to Earth after the destruction of their Space Shuttle in orbit.\\nCuarón wrote the screenplay with his son Jonás and attempted to develop the film at Universal Pictures. Later, the distribution rights were acquired by Warner Bros. Pictures. David Heyman, who previously worked with Cuarón on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), produced the film with him. Gravity was produced entirely in the United Kingdom, where British visual effects company Framestore spent more than three years creating most of the film's visual effects, which involve over 80 of its 91 minutes.\\nGravity opened the 70th Venice International Film Festival on August 28, 2013, and had its North American premiere three days later at the Telluride Film Festival. Upon its release, Gravity was met with widespread critical acclaim, with praise for its direction, visuals, cinematography, acting, and score.

Dr. Ryan Stone is aboard on her first space mission, to perform a set of hardware upgrades on the Hubble. During a spacewalk, Mission Control in Houston warns Explorer's crew about a rapidly expanding cloud of space debris accidentally caused by the Russians having shot down a presumed defunct spy satellite (see Kessler syndrome) and orders the crew to return to Earth immediately. Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly thereafter as more communication satellites are disabled by debris.\\nDebris strikes the Explorer and Hubble, tearing Stone from the shuttle and leaving her tumbling through space. Kowalski, using a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), rescues Stone, and they return to the Explorer, discovering that the Shuttle has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew are dead. Stone and Kowalski decide to use the MMU to reach the International Space Station (ISS), which is in orbit about 1,450\\xa0km (900\\xa0mi) away, Kowalski estimating that they have 90 minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again.\\nOn their way to the ISS, the two discuss Stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. As they approach the station, they see that the ISS's crew has evacuated using one of its two Soyuz spacecraft, the remaining Soyuz spacecraft exhibiting damage with its parachute having been deployed in space rendering it unable to return to Earth. Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby Tiangong space station,[N 1] 100\\xa0km (60\\xa0mi) away, in order to board the Shenzhou spacecraft to return safely to Earth. Out of air and maneuvering fuel, the two try to grab onto the ISS; the duo's tether snags on one of the station's solar panels. Stone's leg gets entangled in the Soyuz's parachute cords and she grabs a strap on Kowalski's suit, but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both. Despite Stone's protests, Kowalski detaches himself from the tether to save her from drifting away with him. Stone is pulled back towards the ISS, while Kowalski floats away.\\nStone enters the space station via the airlock of the Pirs module. She cannot re-establish communication with Kowalski or Earth, and concludes that she is now the sole survivor. Inside the station, a fire breaks out, forcing her to rush to the Soyuz. As she maneuvers the Soyuz away from the ISS, the tangled parachute tethers snag, preventing the spacecraft from leaving; Stone performs a spacewalk to cut the cables, succeeding just as the debris field returns, destroying the station. Stone angles the Soyuz towards Tiangong, but soon discovers that the Soyuz's engine has no fuel.\\nAfter an attempt at radio communication with an Inuit on Earth, Stone resigns herself to her fate and shuts off the cabin's oxygen supply to commit suicide. As she begins to lose consciousness, she experiences a hallucination of Kowalski entering the capsule and telling her to rig the Soyuz's soft landing rockets to propel the capsule towards Tiangong. Stone regains the will to go on, restoring the spacecraft's oxygen flow and rigging the landing rockets to propel the capsule towards Tiangong.\\nUnable to dock with Tiangong, Stone ejects herself from the Soyuz and uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to travel to the rapidly deorbiting Tiangong. Stone manages to enter Tiangong's Shenzhou capsule just as the station enters the upper atmosphere, undocking the capsule just in time.\\nThe Shenzhou capsule re-enters the atmosphere successfully, despite damage during its descent, and lands in a lake. Radio communication from Houston informs Stone that she has been tracked on radar and that rescue crews are on their way. Stone opens the hatch but is unable to exit due to water rushing in. She takes a deep breath and holds it until the capsule sinks, allowing her to swim through the hatch. She sheds her Sokol space suit that is weighing her down, and crawls onto the beach before standing up triumphantly and walking away.\\n\"},\n",

Instead, she hangs around the house all weekend listening to the Natasha Bedingfield song \"Pocketful of Sunshine\" from a musical greeting card her grandmother sent her. The following Monday, Rhiannon presses Olive until she lies about losing her virginity to a college boy. Marianne Bryant, a devout Christian whom Olive considers to be prudish, overhears her telling the lie and it soon spreads throughout the school. The school\\'s church group, run by Marianne, decides to \"save\" Olive from her supposed promiscuity. Olive confides the truth to her friend Brandon, who is bullied by other students for being gay. Brandon asks Olive to pretend to have sex with him at a party so the other students will believe he is straight, to which she agrees.\\nAfter a fight with Rhiannon over her new reputation as a \"dirty skank\", Olive decides to counteract the harassment by embracing her new image as the school tramp, wearing more provocative clothing and stitching a red \"A\" onto her clothing, inspired by Hester Prynne from Nathaniel Hawthorne\\'s 1850 novel The Scarlet Letter, which she was reading in her English class.

It is set primarily in 19th-century Wismar, Germany and Transylvania, and was conceived as a stylistic remake of F. W. Murnau\\'s 1922 German Dracula adaptation Nosferatu. The picture stars Klaus Kinski as Count Dracula, Isabelle Adjani as Lucy Harker, Bruno Ganz as Jonathan Harker, and French artist-writer Roland Topor as Renfield. There are two different versions of the film, one in which the actors speak English, and one in which they speak German.[3]\\nHerzog\\'s production of Nosferatu was very well received by critics and enjoyed a comfortable degree of commercial success.[4] The film also marks the second of five collaborations between director Herzog and actor Kinski,[5] immediately followed by 1979\\'s Woyzeck. The film had 1,000,000 admissions in West Germany and grossed ITL 53,870,000 in Italy.[6] It was also a modest success in Adjani\\'s home country, taking in 933,533 admissions in France.[7]\\nA novelization of the screenplay was written by Paul Monette and published by both Avon Publishing (ISBN\\xa0978-0380441075) and Picador (ISBN\\xa0978-0330259293) in 1979. The 1988 Italian horror film Nosferatu in Venice is a \"sequel-in-name-only\",[8] again featuring Kinski in the title role.[9]\\n\\nPlot: Jonathan Harker is an estate agent in Wismar, Germany. His employer, Renfield, informs him that a nobleman named Count Dracula wishes to buy a property in Wismar and assigns Harker to visit the Count and complete the lucrative deal. Leaving his young wife Lucy behind in Wismar, Harker travels to Transylvania, to Count Dracula\\'s castle, in a journey that lasts four weeks, carrying with him the deeds and documents needed to sell the house to the Count. On his trip, Harker stops at a village inn, where the locals plead for him to stay away from the accursed castle, providing him with details of Dracula\\'s vampirism. Ignoring the villagers\\' pleas as superstition, Harker continues his journey, ascending the Borgo Pass on foot and eventually arriving at Dracula\\'s castle, where he meets the Count, a strange, almost rodent-like man, with large ears, pale skin, sharp teeth, and long fingernails.\\nThe Count is enchanted by a small portrait of Lucy and immediately agrees to purchase the Wismar property, especially with the knowledge that he and Lucy would become neighbors. As Jonathan\\'s visit progresses, he is haunted at night by several dream-like encounters with the vampiric Count. Simultaneously, in Wismar, Lucy is tormented by night terrors, plagued by images of impending doom. Additionally, Renfield is committed to an asylum after biting a cow, apparently having gone completely insane. To Harker\\'s horror, he finds the Count asleep in a coffin, confirming for him that Dracula is indeed a vampire. That night, Dracula leaves for Wismar, taking several coffins filled with the cursed earth that he needs for his vampiric rest. Harker finds that he is imprisoned in the castle and attempts to escape through a window via a makeshift rope fashioned from bedsheets. The rope is not long enough, and Jonathan falls, severely injuring himself. The next morning, he awakes on the ground, stirred by the sound of a young Romani boy playing the violin. He is eventually sent to a hospital and raves about \\'black coffins\\' to doctors, who assume that the illness affects his mind.\\nMeanwhile, Dracula and his coffins travel to Wismar by ship via the Black Sea port of Varna, thence through the Bosphorus and the Strait of Gibraltar and around the entire west European Atlantic coast to the Baltic Sea. He systematically kills the whole crew, making it appear as if they were afflicted with the plague. The ghost ship arrives, with its cargo, at Wismar, where doctors – including Abraham Van Helsing – investigate the strange fate of the vessel. They discover a ship\\'s log that mentions their perceived affliction with the plague. Wismar is then flooded with rats from the ship. Dracula arrives in Wismar with his coffins, and death spreads rapidly throughout the town. The desperately ill Jonathan is finally transported home, but he does not appear to recognize his wife when he finally arrives. Lucy later encounters Count Dracula; weary and unable to die, he demands some of the love that she gave so freely to Jonathan, but she refuses, much to Dracula\\'s dismay. Now aware that something other than plague is responsible for the death that has beset her once-peaceful town, Lucy desperately tries to convince the townspeople, but they are skeptical and uninterested, engaging in a danse macabre and a grotesque caricature of the Last Supper. From a book given to Jonathan by the people in Transylvania, she finds that she can defeat Dracula\\'s evil by distracting him until dawn, at which time the rays of the sun will destroy him, but only at the cost of her own life. That night, she lures the Count to her bedroom, where he proceeds to drink her blood.\\nLucy\\'s beauty and purity distract Dracula from the call of the rooster, and at the first light of day, he collapses to the floor, dead. Van Helsing arrives to discover Lucy dead but victorious. He then drives a stake through the heart of the Count to make sure that Lucy\\'s sacrifice was not in vain. In a final ironic twist, Jonathan awakens from his sickness, now a vampire, and has Van Helsing arrested for the murder of Count Dracula. He then states enigmatically that he has much to do and is last seen riding away on horseback, garbed in the same fluttering black as Dracula.\\n'},\n",

It centers on a young couple (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat) who are haunted by a supernatural presence inside their home. They then set up a camera to document what is haunting them. The film uses found-footage conventions that were mirrored in the later films of the series.\\nOriginally developed as an independent feature and given film festival screenings in 2007, the film was shot for $15,000. It was then acquired by Paramount Pictures and modified, particularly with a new ending that cost an additional $200,000. It was given a limited U.S. release on September 25, 2009, and then a nationwide release on October 16, 2009. The film earned nearly $108 million at the U.S. box office and a further $85 million internationally for a worldwide total of $194 million.[7] Paramount/DreamWorks acquired the U.S. rights for $350,000. It is often cited as the most profitable film ever made, based on proportionate return on investment, although such figures are difficult to verify independently[8] as this is likely to exclude marketing costs.[9]\\nThe film is the first entry in the Paranormal Activity film series. A parallel sequel, Paranormal Activity 2, was released in 2010.

Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. Psychic Dr. Fredrichs visits Katie and Micah, who suggests Katie is being haunted by a demon that feeds off of negative energy and is intent on tormenting her. He advises not to communicate with the demon without a demonologist, but Micah continues to film and seek it out.\\nThe camera captures many strange occurrences during the night; they start off as minor noises, flickering lights, and bedroom door movements, but over time escalate into loud thuds, violent door slamming, and demonic grunts and screeches. One night, Katie appears to be in a trance; she gets up, stands beside the bed staring at Micah for two hours, and goes outside, none of which she recalls the next day.\\nMicah brings home a Ouija board. When the couple leaves the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the board's pointer on its surface, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie is increasingly aggravated by Micah's flippant behavior and pleads to contact the demonologist, but he refuses. The couple finds non-human footsteps on baby powder Micah sprinkled in the hallway; its path leads to a burnt photograph of a young Katie in the attic, thought to have been destroyed in a house fire. Outside intervention is unavailable, as the demonologist is out of the country and Dr. Fredrichs is afraid of making the demon angrier. That night, Katie is pulled out of the bedroom by an unseen force. Micah discovers a bite mark on Katie's back the morning after, motivating him to get out of the house, but Katie abruptly insists on staying.\\nOn night twenty-one, Katie gets out of bed again and stares at Micah for two hours before going downstairs. Katie screams profusely for Micah and he quickly rushes to help her. Afterward, Micah screams in pain with loud thuds. After a moment of silence, Micah's body is violently hurled at the camera which is knocked off the tripod, revealing Katie standing in the doorway with blood on her shirt. She crawls to Micah's body, then looks up at the camera with a grin. As she lunges toward the camera, her face takes on a demonic snarl, and the scene cuts to black. The epilogue text states Micah's body is discovered by the police, and Katie is missing.\\n\"},\n",

       "  'Description': 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Italian: Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo, literally \"The good, the ugly, the bad\") is a 1966 Italian epic spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood as \"the Good\", Lee Van Cleef as \"the Bad\", and Eli Wallach as \"the Ugly\".[9] Its screenplay was written by Age & Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni, and Leone (with additional screenplay material and dialogue provided by an uncredited Sergio Donati),[10] based on a story by Vincenzoni and Leone. Director of photography Tonino Delli Colli was responsible for the film\\'s sweeping widescreen cinematography, and Ennio Morricone composed the film\\'s score, including its main theme. It was an Italian-led production with co-producers in Spain, West Germany, and the United States. Most of the filming took place in Spain.\\nThe film is known for Leone\\'s use of long shots and close-up cinematography, as well as his distinctive use of violence, tension, and highly stylised gunfights. The plot revolves around three gunslingers competing to find a fortune in a buried cache of Confederate gold amid the violent chaos of the American Civil War (specifically the Battle of Glorieta Pass of the New Mexico Campaign in 1862) while participating in many battles, confrontations, and duels along the way.[11] The film was the third collaboration between Leone and Clint Eastwood, and the second with Lee Van Cleef.\\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly was marketed as the third and final installment in the Dollars Trilogy, following A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. The film was a financial success, grossing over $38\\xa0million at the worldwide box office, and is credited with having catapulted Eastwood into stardom.[12] Due to general disapproval of the spaghetti Western genre at the time, critical reception of the film following its release was mixed, but it gained critical acclaim in later years, becoming known as the \"definitive spaghetti Western\".\\n\\nPlot: In 1862, in the American Southwest during the Civil War, three bounty hunters attack Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez and die by his hand. Elsewhere, mercenary \"Angel Eyes\" interrogates former Confederate soldier Stevens, whom he has been hired to kill. In an attempt to save his life, Stevens tells Angel Eyes about Jackson, a fugitive who stole a cache of Confederate gold. Jackson\\'s new alias is \"Bill Carson\". Angel Eyes kills Stevens and then his own employer, so he can find the gold himself. Tuco is rescued from another three bounty hunters by a drifter, whom he calls \"Blondie\". Blondie delivers Tuco to a sheriff and collects his $2,000 bounty. As Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie severs his noose by shooting it and setting him free. The two escape and split the bounty. They repeat the process in another town until Blondie grows weary of Tuco\\'s complaints and strands him in the desert.\\nBent on revenge, and after one failed attempt with his gang, Tuco finally catches up with Blondie and force-marches him across the desert until Blondie collapses from dehydration. A runaway ambulance arrives with several dead Confederate soldiers and a near-death Bill Carson, who promises Tuco $200,000 in Confederate gold, buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery, in exchange for help. When Tuco returns with water, Carson has died, and Blondie is slumped next to him. However, before dying, Carson has revealed the name on the grave to Blondie. Despite being mortal enemies, Blondie and Tuco realize they need one another alive to find the gold since only Tuco knows the name of the cemetery and only Blondie knows which grave to dig.\\nPosing as a Confederate soldier, Tuco takes Blondie to a nearby mission to recover. There, Tuco reunites with his brother, Pablo, who left his family to become a priest when Tuco was just a child. Their meeting does not go well and they quickly become hostile. Tuco and Blondie subsequently leave.\\nThe duo continues on their search for the gold.  Tuco yells pro-Confederate statements to a distant group of soldiers, but they turn out to be members of a Union patrol. The two are taken to a prison camp that Angel Eyes has infiltrated as a Union sergeant in his search for Bill Carson. Tuco poses as Carson and is taken away for questioning. He reveals the name of the cemetery under torture and is sent away to be hanged. Knowing Blondie would not reveal the name on the grave, Angel Eyes recruits him into his search. Tuco escapes hanging by killing henchman working for Angel Eyes.  Tuco soon finds himself in an evacuated town where Blondie, Angel Eyes and his gang have arrived.\\nBlondie finds Tuco and together they kill the gang, but Angel Eyes manages to escape.  Once again, they travel toward Sad Hill.  They find themselves on the Union Army\\'s side of a skirmish involving a military siege with Confederates over a strategic bridge. Blondie decides to destroy the bridge to disperse the two armies and clear their path. As they wire the bridge with explosives, \\nTuco suggests they share the location of the grave with each other in case either is killed. Tuco reveals the name of the cemetery while Blondie says \"Arch Stanton\" is the name on the grave. After the bridge is demolished, the armies disperse. Tuco steals a horse and rides to Sad Hill to claim the gold for himself. Blondie and Angel Eyes catch up to him as he digs up the grave, which contains no gold. Blondie admits lying about the name, then proposes to write the name on a rock and place it in the middle of the cemetery\\'s pavement.\\n'},\n",

It was followed by For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, also starring Eastwood. Collectively, the films are known as the Dollars Trilogy, or the Man with No Name Trilogy after the United Artists publicity campaign referred to Eastwood\\'s character in all three films as the \"Man with No Name\". All three films were later released in sequence in the United States in 1967, catapulting Eastwood into stardom.[6] The film has been identified as an unofficial remake of the Akira Kurosawa film Yojimbo (1961), which resulted in a successful lawsuit by Toho, Yojimbo\\'s production company.[citation needed]\\nAs few Spaghetti Westerns had yet been released in the United States, many of the European cast and crew took on American-sounding stage names. These included Leone himself (\"Bob Robertson\"), Gian Maria Volonté (\"Johnny Wels\"), and composer Ennio Morricone (\"Dan Savio\"). A Fistful of Dollars was shot in Spain, mostly near Hoyo de Manzanares[7] close to Madrid, but also (like its two sequels) in the Tabernas Desert and in the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park, both in the province of Almería.\\n\\nPlot: An unnamed stranger[N 1] arrives at the little town of San Miguel, on the Mexico–United States border. Silvanito, the town\\'s innkeeper, tells the Stranger about a feud between two smuggler families vying to gain control of the town: the Rojo brothers (Don Miguel, Esteban & Ramón), and the family comprising the town sheriff John Baxter, his matriarchal wife Consuelo, and their son Antonio. The Stranger (in order to make money) decides to play these families against each other. He demonstrates his speed and accuracy with his gun, to both sides, by shooting with ease four men, including the three who insulted him as he entered the town.\\nThe Stranger seizes an opportunity when he sees the Rojos massacre a detachment of Mexican soldiers who were escorting a chest of gold (which they had planned to exchange for a shipment of new rifles). He takes two of the dead bodies to a nearby cemetery and sells information to each of the two groups, saying that two Mexican soldiers survived the attack. Each faction races to the cemetery, the Baxters to get the supposed survivors to testify against the Rojos and the Rojos to silence them; they engage in a gunfight, with Ramón appearing to kill the supposed survivors and Esteban capturing Antonio Baxter. \\nWhile the Rojos and the Baxters are fighting, the Stranger searches the Rojo hacienda for the gold. While he is searching he accidentally knocks out a woman, Marisol. He takes her to the Baxters, who, in turn, arrange to return her to the Rojos in exchange for Antonio. During the exchange, Marisol\\'s son, Jesús, runs towards her, followed by her husband, Julio. While the family embraces, Ramón orders one of his men, Rubio, to kill her husband as he has already told him to leave town. Silvanito attempts to protect the family with a shotgun with the Stranger backing him up. Neither Ramón nor any of his men attempt to challenge the Stranger, knowing that he is too fast on the draw. The Stranger then tells Marisol to go with Ramón, and for her husband to take their son home. He learns from Silvanito that Ramón framed Julio as a cheat during a card game and took Marisol prisoner, forcing her to live with him. \\nThat night, while the Rojos are celebrating, the Stranger rides out and frees Marisol, shooting the guards and wrecking the house in which she is being held to create the appearance of an attack by the Baxters. He gives money to Marisol, urging her and her family to leave the town. When the Rojos discover the Stranger has freed Marisol, they capture and torture him; nevertheless, he escapes them. Believing he is being protected by the Baxters, the Rojos set fire to the Baxter home, massacring them as they flee the burning building. After pretending he will spare their lives, Ramón kills the pleading John and Antonio Baxter. Consuelo, appearing and finding her family dead, curses the Rojos for killing unarmed men. She is then shot dead by Esteban. With help from the local coffin-maker named Piripero, the Stranger escapes town by hiding in a coffin. \\nThe Stranger convalesces inside a nearby mine, but when Piripero tells him that Silvanito has been captured and is being tortured by the Rojos for information on the Stranger\\'s whereabouts, he returns to town to confront them. With a steel chest-plate hidden beneath his poncho, he taunts Ramón to \"aim for the heart\" as Ramón\\'s shots deflect off until Ramón exhausts his Winchester rifle\\'s ammunition. The Stranger shoots the weapon from Ramón\\'s hand and kills Don Miguel, Rubio, and the other Rojo men standing nearby. He then uses the last bullet in his gun to free Silvanito, who is hanging from a rope by his hands. After challenging Ramón to reload his rifle faster than he can reload his own revolver, the Stranger shoots and kills Ramón. Esteban Rojo aims for the Stranger\\'s back from a nearby building but is shot dead by Silvanito. The Stranger bids Silvanito and Piripero farewell and rides away from town.\\n'},\n",

As they travel together, Natalie challenges Ryan\\'s philosophies on life, particularly regarding relationships and love, but Ryan defends his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie\\'s boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message. Ryan and Alex comfort the shattered Natalie. On a video termination test run, Ryan\\'s earlier concerns prove valid; when one laid-off person breaks down on camera, Natalie is unable to properly console him and another employee threatens suicide.\\nNatalie castigates Ryan for his inability to commit to Alex, despite their obvious compatibility; Ryan dismisses her criticisms and chastises her for lacking empathy and never appreciating her surroundings.

In Las Vegas for a prestigious speaking engagement, Ryan abruptly walks offstage mid-presentation and impulsively flies to Chicago to see Alex. Arriving at her front door, he is stunned to discover that she is married and has children. She later phones, chastising him for nearly wrecking her marriage, and says her family is her real life; he is merely an escape.\\nOn Ryan\\'s flight home, the crew announces that he has just crossed the ten million mile mark. American Airlines\\' chief pilot is aboard to personally congratulate Ryan and notes he is the youngest person to achieve the milestone. When asked where he is from, Ryan, realizing he has no real home, simply says, \"here.\" Back in Omaha, Ryan transfers a million frequent flyer miles to Julie and Jim so they can have a honeymoon. Craig informs Ryan that a laid-off employee has committed suicide (the same one who had threatened to do so earlier). Natalie, upset over the news, quits via text message. The remote-layoff program is stopped, and Ryan is sent back on the road.\\nNatalie applies to the same San Francisco company where she had previously declined a position, having followed her now ex-boyfriend to Omaha. Impressed by her qualifications and Ryan\\'s glowing written recommendation, the interviewer hires her. The film concludes with Ryan at the airport, standing in front of a vast destination board, contemplating where he should travel next (something Natalie encouraged him to do earlier).

His only companion is an artificial intelligence named GERTY, who assists with the base\\'s automation and provides comfort for him.\\nTwo weeks before his return to Earth, Sam begins to suffer from hallucinations of a teenage girl and a bearded, disheveled man. One such image distracts him while he is out recovering a helium-3 canister from a harvester, causing him to crash his lunar rover into the harvester. Rapidly losing cabin air from the crash, Sam falls unconscious.\\nSam awakes in the base infirmary with no memory of the accident. He overhears GERTY having what appears to be a live chat with Lunar Industries management. Lunar Industries then orders Sam to remain on base and informs him that a rescue team will arrive to repair the harvester. Suspicious, Sam manufactures a fake problem to persuade GERTY to let him outside. He travels to the crashed rover, where he finds his unconscious doppelganger. He brings the double back to the base and tends to his injuries. The two Sams start to wonder if one is a clone of the other. After a heated argument and physical altercation, GERTY reveals that they are both clones of the original Sam Bell. GERTY activated the newest clone after the rover crash and convinced him that he was at the beginning of his three-year contract. GERTY confirms his memories of his wife and daughter are implanted.\\nThe two Sams search the area, finding a communications substation beyond the facility\\'s perimeter which has been interfering with the live feed from Earth. GERTY helps the older Sam access the recorded logs of past Sam clones, showing them all falling ill as their contract expires. Later, the older Sam discovers a secret vault containing hundreds of hibernating clones. They determine that Lunar Industries is unethically using clones of the original Sam Bell to avoid the cost of training and transporting new astronauts, as well as deliberately jamming the live feed in order to prevent the clones from contacting Earth; clones who believe they are entering hibernation at the end of their contract just before their final return to Earth are in fact incinerated. The older Sam clone drives past the interference radius in a second rover and tries to call Tess on Earth. He instead makes contact with Eve, now 15 years old, who says Tess died \"some years ago\". He hangs up when Eve tells her father (offscreen, identified as \"Original Sam\" in closed captioning) that someone is calling regarding Tess. After he returns, the older Sam begins displaying the same symptoms as previous clones as they begin to deteriorate.\\nThe two Sams realize that the incoming rescue team will kill them both if they are found together. The newer Sam convinces GERTY to wake another clone, planning to leave the awakened clone in the crashed rover and send the older Sam to Earth in one of the helium-3 transports. But the older Sam, having learned that the clones are designed to break down at the end of the 3-year contract, knows that he will not live much longer. With his health rapidly declining, the older Sam suggests that he be placed back into the crashed rover to die so that Lunar Industries will not suspect anything, while the newer Sam escapes instead.\\nFollowing GERTY\\'s advice, the newer Sam reboots GERTY to wipe its records of the events. Before leaving, the newer clone reprograms a harvester to crash and wreck the jamming antenna, thereby enabling live communications with Earth; he also brings along a canister of helium-3 to provide him with funds once he reaches Earth. The older Sam, back in the crippled rover, remains conscious long enough to watch the launch of the transport carrying the newer Sam to Earth. The rescue team is successfully fooled after finding both a newly-awakened clone in the medical bay and the corpse of the older Sam inside the crashed rover.\\nThe helium transport approaches Earth\\'s atmosphere, and over the film\\'s closing scene, news reports describe how Sam\\'s testimony on Lunar Industries\\' activities has stirred up an enormous controversy, and the company\\'s unethical practices have caused their stock to plummet.\\n'},\n",

It stars Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan in lead roles, and it was produced by Jerry Weintraub, James Lassiter, Ken Stovitz, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. This film does not take place in the same fictional universe as the four previous Karate Kid films, but is instead a remake of the original 1984 film with the setting moved to China, and the martial art changed (despite the film's title) from karate to kung fu.\\nThe plot concerns 12-year-old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith), from Detroit, Michigan, who moves to Beijing, China with his mother (Taraji P. Henson) and runs afoul of the neighborhood bully Cheng (Zhenwei Wang). He makes an unlikely ally in the form of an aging maintenance man, Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), a kung fu master who teaches him the secrets of self-defense. The screenplay was written by Christopher Murphey. The film's music was composed by James Horner. It is an international co-production between China, Hong Kong, and the United States.\\nPrincipal photography took place in Beijing, China, and filming began in July 2009 and ended on October 16. The Karate Kid was released theatrically worldwide on June 11, 2010, by Sony Pictures. The film earned $359 million on a $40 million budget.\\n\\nPlot: 12-year-old Dre Parker leaves Detroit for Beijing after his widowed mother Sherry gets a job transfer at a car factory. There, Dre meets Meiying, a young violinist who reciprocates his attention. However, 15-year-old Cheng, a rebellious Kung Fu prodigy whose family is close to Meiying's, keeps them apart by constantly attacking, teasing and bullying Dre. As revenge, Dre throws a bucket of dirty water over Cheng and his gang after a school field trip to the Forbidden City. Enraged, they chase, corner and brutally beat Dre at an alley. Mr. Han, a maintenance man who repaired for Sherry, intervenes and fends off the boys, revealing himself to be a Kung Fu master.\\nMr. Han heals Dre's injuries using the ancient Chinese medicine methods of fire cupping. He explains that Cheng and his friends are not inherently bad, but made so by Master Li, who teaches his students to be merciless towards their enemies. Intrigued, Dre asks if Han could teach him Kung Fu. Mr. Han refuses and instead brings him to Li's Fighting Dragon studio to make peace. Li harshly rebuffs the peace offer and challenges Dre to a fight with Cheng. Mr. Han instead counters that Dre compete against Li's students at an upcoming Kung Fu tournament. He requests that his students leave Dre alone to train until then. Li begrudgingly accepts as long as Dre shows up at the tournament.\\nMr. Han begins to teach Dre Kung Fu by emphasizing movements that apply to life in general. He conveys that serenity and maturity, not punches and power, are the true keys to mastering Kung fu. Han makes Dre repeatedly take off and pick up his jacket. Through this, Dre develops muscle memory. Han takes him to a Taoist temple in the Wudang Mountains. There, Dre witnesses a woman making a cobra reflect her movements and later drinks the water from a Taoist well. After many weeks of laborious training, Mr. Han gives Dre a day off. Dre goes to see Meiying, persuading her to cut school for a day of fun. This makes her nearly late for a violin audition, and her parents thus deem Dre a bad influence, forbidding her from ever seeing him again.\\nDre heads to see Mr. Han, but finds him drunk and depressed, smashing a car he was working on. Mr. Han tearfully explains that he crashed the same car years ago, which killed his wife Zhang and 10-year-old son Gong Gong. He fixes the car every year but smashes it to remind himself of what happened. Dre decides to train harder and help his teacher overcome his trauma. Mr. Han assists Dre in writing and reciting a note of apology in Mandarin to Meiying's father. Meiying's father accepts Dre's apology. In return, he promises that Meiying will attend the tournament to support Dre.\\nAt the tournament, the under-confident Dre starts defeating all of his opponents. Enraged, Li orders Liang, one of his students, to injure Dre in the semi-finals. Liang reluctantly does so by delivering a series of crippling blows to Dre's leg. He gets disqualified as a result, and Dre advances to the final against Cheng. Dre pleads with Mr. Han to heal his leg via the fire cupping method. Realizing this is more about overcoming Dre's fear than anything else, Mr. Han complies.\\nThe final match starts. On Li's orders, Cheng attacks Dre's injured leg. This causes Dre to lose balance. Dre struggles but manages to get up and uses the snake stance he saw at the temple. The move is successful, and Dre catches Cheng with a kick to the head, defeating him. Dre wins the tournament, earning the respect of Cheng and his classmates. Cheng presents Dre with the trophy and all of the Fighting Dragon students bow down to Mr. Han, accepting him as their new master, leaving Li defeated.\\n\"},\n",

It is the first installment in the Avatar film series. It is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the valuable mineral unobtanium.[a] The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na\\'vi, a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The title of the film refers to a genetically engineered Na\\'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.[10]\\nDevelopment of Avatar began in 1994, when James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film.[11][12] Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron\\'s 1997 film Titanic, for a planned release in 1999;[13] however, according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the film.[14] Work on the language of the Na\\'vi began in 2005, and Cameron began developing the screenplay and fictional universe in early 2006.[15][16] Avatar was officially budgeted at $237\\xa0million, due to the groundbreaking array of new visual effects Cameron achieved in cooperation with Weta Digital in Wellington.[4] Other estimates put the cost at between $280\\xa0million and $310\\xa0million for production and at $150\\xa0million for promotion.[17][18][19] The film made extensive use of new motion capture filming techniques and was released for traditional viewing, 3D viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats), and \"4D\" experiences in selected South Korean theaters.[20]\\nAvatar premiered on December 10, 2009, in London and was released in the United States on December 18, 2009, to positive reviews. Critics highly praised its groundbreaking visual effects, though the story was considered to be predictable.[21][22][23] During its theatrical run, the film broke several box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. In July 2019, this position was overtaken by Avengers: Endgame, but with subsequent re-releases, beginning with China in March 2021, it returned to becoming the highest-grossing film since then.[24] Adjusted for inflation, Avatar is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time, only behind Gone with the Wind, with a total of a little more than $3.5 billion. It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion[25] and the best-selling video title of 2010 in the United States. Avatar was nominated for nine awards at the 82nd Academy Awards, winning three, and received numerous other accolades. The success of the film also led to electronics manufacturers releasing 3D televisions[26] and caused 3D films[27] to increase in popularity. Its success led to the Avatar franchise, which includes the sequels Avatar: The Way of Water (2022), Avatar 3 (2025), Avatar 4 (2029), and Avatar 5 (2031).\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'Moneyball is a 2011 American biographical sports drama film directed by Bennett Miller with a script by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin from a story by Stan Chervin. The film is based on the 2003 nonfiction book, \"Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game\",  by Michael Lewis. The book is an account of the Oakland Athletics baseball team\\'s 2002 season and their general manager Billy Beane\\'s attempts to assemble a competitive team. In the film, Beane (Brad Pitt) and assistant general manager Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), faced with the franchise\\'s limited budget for players, build a team of undervalued talent by taking a sophisticated sabermetric approach to scouting and analyzing players. Philip Seymour Hoffman also stars as Art Howe.\\nColumbia Pictures bought the rights to Lewis\\'s book in 2004, hiring Chervin to write the screenplay. David Frankel was initially set to direct with Zaillian now writing the screenplay, but was soon replaced by Steven Soderbergh, who planned to make the film in a semi-documentary style featuring interviews from real athletes, and having the real players and coaches on the team portray themselves. But before its July 2009 filming start, the film was put in turnaround due to creative differences between Soderbergh and Sony over a last-minute script rewrite. Soderbergh exited, and Miller was hired to direct, with Pitt becoming a producer and Sorkin hired for rewrites. Filming began in July 2010 at various stadiums such as Dodger Stadium and Oakland Coliseum.\\nMoneyball premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and was released on September 23, 2011, to box office success and critical acclaim, particularly for its acting and screenplay. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor for Pitt and Best Supporting Actor for Hill.\\n\\nPlot: Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, is devastated by the team\\'s loss to the New York Yankees in the 2001 American League Division Series.[4] With the impending departure of star players Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, and Jason Isringhausen to free agency, Beane needs to assemble a competitive team for 2002 with Oakland\\'s limited budget of 41 million dollars [[1]].\\nDuring a scouting visit to the Cleveland Indians, Beane meets Peter Brand, a young Yale economics graduate with radical ideas about evaluating players. Beane asks whether Brand would have drafted him out of high school; though scouts considered Beane promising, his career in the major leagues was disappointing. Brand says he would not have drafted him until the ninth round and intuits that Beane would\\'ve thereby turned down the Mets\\' offer and gone to Stanford on a full sports scholarship instead. Impressed, Beane hires him.\\nUsing Brand\\'s sabermetric method, Beane signs undervalued players such as Chad Bradford, Jeremy Giambi, and Scott Hatteberg, and also trades for David Justice. The Athletics\\' scouts are hostile toward the strategy, and Beane fires the head scout, Grady Fuson, after a heated confrontation. Beane also faces opposition from Art Howe, the Athletics\\' manager. Howe disregards Beane\\'s and Brand\\'s strategy and uses a more traditional lineup.\\nEarly in the season, the Athletics are already 10 games behind first, leading critics to dismiss the new method as a failure. Brand argues that their sample size is too small to conclude that the method does not work, and Beane convinces the team owner, Stephen Schott, to stay the course. To get help on defense, Beane trades Giambi to the Phillies for John Mabry and the only traditional first baseman, Carlos Peña, to the Tigers, leaving Howe no choice but to use the team that Beane and Brand have designed. Three weeks later, the Athletics are only four games behind first.\\nBefore the trade deadline, Beane acquires the relief pitcher Ricardo Rincón from the Indians, and on August 13, the Athletics start a winning streak. Beane, superstitiously, refuses to watch games in progress, but when the Athletics tie the American League record of 19 consecutive wins, his daughter persuades him to attend the next game against the Kansas City Royals. Oakland is leading 11–0 when Beane arrives in the fourth inning, only to watch the Royals even the score by the top of the ninth. Thanks to a walk-off home run by Hatteberg, the Athletics achieve a then record-breaking 20th consecutive win. Beane tells Brand he will not be satisfied until they have changed baseball by winning the World Series.\\nThe Athletics win the American League West but lose to the Minnesota Twins in the American League Division Series, with an unseen baseball analyst explaining that some other tangibles of a player, such as drive and clutch performance, cannot be measured. The owner of the Boston Red Sox, John W. Henry, realizes that sabermetrics is the future of baseball. He makes Beane an offer to become the Red Sox general manager for a $12.5 million salary, which would make him the highest-paid general manager in sports history. In Oakland, Beane discloses the offer to Brand and says that their strategy failed. Brand shows a video of a heavyset batter, Jeremy Brown, who hits a home run but does not realize it; Billy understands what Brand is trying to say and thanks him. In his car, an emotional Beane listens to a cover of \"The Show\" recorded by his daughter in which she tells him to \"just enjoy the show.”\\nIn an epilogue, Beane turns down Henry\\'s offer, but the Red Sox still end up winning the World Series two years later using Beane and Brand\\'s model.\\n'},\n",

Despite receiving acclaim from critics, the film was a box office bomb, grossing just $185 million against its estimated $150 million budget.\\n\\nPlot: In 1931 Paris, 12-year-old Hugo Cabret lives with his widowed father, a clockmaker who works at a museum. Hugo\\'s father finds a broken automaton – a mechanical man created to write with a pen. He and Hugo try to repair it, documenting their work in a notebook. When his father dies in a fire, Hugo goes to live with his father\\'s alcoholic brother, Uncle Claude, who maintains the clocks at Gare Montparnasse railway station. When Claude goes missing, Hugo continues maintaining the clocks, fearing that the Station Inspector named Gustave Dasté will send him away if Claude\\'s absence is discovered. Hugo attempts to repair the automaton with stolen parts, believing it contains a message from his father, but the machine requires a heart-shaped key.\\nHugo is caught stealing parts from a toy store, and the owner, Georges, takes his notebook, threatening to destroy it. Georges\\' goddaughter Isabelle suggests that Hugo confront Georges and demand it back. Georges proposes that Hugo work at his toy store as recompense, and after some time he might return the notebook. Hugo accepts and commences work, in addition to his job maintaining the clocks. Isabelle and Hugo become fast friends, and Hugo is astonished to see she wears a heart-shaped key, given to her by Georges. Hugo shows her the automaton, which they activate with the key. It draws a scene from the 1902 film A Trip to the Moon, once described to Hugo by his father. Isabelle identifies the drawing\\'s signature as that of \"Georges Méliès\" – her godfather. She sneaks Hugo into her home, where they find a hidden cache of drawings, but they are discovered by Georges.\\nSeveral days later, at the Film Academy Library, Hugo and Isabelle find a book about the history of cinema that praises Méliès\\' contributions. They meet the book\\'s author, René Tabard, a film expert who is surprised to hear Méliès is alive, as he disappeared after World War I along with the copies of his films. Excited at the chance to meet Méliès again, René agrees to meet Isabelle and Hugo at Georges\\' home to show his copy of A Trip to the Moon.\\nFinding the heart-shaped key on the station railway tracks, Hugo drops down to the track to retrieve it, and is run over by an out-of-control train that smashes through the station. He wakes up from the nightmare, but hears an ominous ticking emanating from himself, and discovers he has been turned into the automaton. Hugo wakes up again: it was only another nightmare.\\nAt Georges’ home, his wife Jeanne allows them in after René recognises her as Jeanne d\\'Alcy, an actress in many of Méliès\\' films. They play the film, waking Georges, who is finally convinced to cherish his accomplishments rather than regret his lost dreams. Georges recounts that, as a stage magician, he was fascinated by motion pictures and used film to create imaginative works through his Star Film Company. Forced into bankruptcy after the war, he closed his studio and sold his films. He laments that even an automaton he built and donated to a museum was lost; Hugo realizes it is the one he has repaired.\\nHugo races to the station to retrieve the automaton but is caught by Gustave, who has learned of Claude\\'s death. Gustave threatens to take Hugo to the orphanage. Hugo runs away and manages to evade Gustave by hiding on the outer face of the clock tower, precariously balancing hundreds of feet above the ground. After climbing back down, Hugo races to escape the station but drops the automaton on the tracks. He jumps down to retrieve it and is almost run over by a train, but Gustave saves him and the automaton. Georges arrives and tells Gustave, \"This boy belongs to me.\"\\nSometime later, Georges is named a professor at the Film Academy, and is paid tribute through a showcase of his films recovered by René. Hugo and his new family celebrate at the apartment, and Isabelle begins to write down Hugo\\'s own story.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'The Getaway is a 1972 American heist thriller film based on the 1958 novel by Jim Thompson. The film was directed by Sam Peckinpah, written by Walter Hill, and stars Steve McQueen, Ali MacGraw, Ben Johnson, Al Lettieri, and Sally Struthers. The plot follows imprisoned mastermind robber Carter \"Doc\" McCoy (McQueen), whose wife Carol (MacGraw) conspires for his release on the condition they rob a bank in Texas. A double-cross follows the crime and the McCoys are forced to flee for Mexico with the police and criminals in hot pursuit.\\nPeter Bogdanovich, whose The Last Picture Show impressed McQueen and producer David Foster, was originally hired as the director of The Getaway. Thompson came on board to write the screenplay, but creative differences ensued between him and McQueen and he was subsequently fired along with Bogdanovich. Writing and directing duties eventually went to Hill and Peckinpah, respectively. Principal photography commenced on February 7, 1972, on location in Texas. The film reunited McQueen and Peckinpah, who had worked together on the relatively unprofitable Junior Bonner which was released the same year.\\nThe Getaway premiered on December 13, 1972. Despite the negative reviews it received upon release, numerous retrospective critics gave the film good reviews. A box office hit earning over $36 million, it was the eighth highest-grossing film of 1972, and was one of the most financially successful productions of Peckinpah\\'s and McQueen\\'s careers. A film remake of the same name starring Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger was released in 1994.\\n\\nPlot: Four years into his ten-year sentence for armed robbery, Carter \"Doc\" McCoy is denied parole from a Texas prison. When his wife Carol visits him, he tells her to do whatever is necessary to make a deal with Jack Beynon, a corrupt businessman in San Antonio, to free him. Beynon uses his influence and obtains Doc\\'s parole on the condition that he plan and take part in a bank robbery with two of his henchmen, Rudy Butler and Frank Jackson. The robbery initially goes as planned, until Frank kills a security guard. Rudy then attempts a double-cross, shooting Frank in the groin as they drive away and kicking him out of their moving car, killing him. At their designated meeting place, Rudy tries to draw on Doc, but Doc anticipates Rudy\\'s double-cross and shoots Rudy several times. Doc and Carol take the $500,000 and leave. Rudy, having secretly worn a bulletproof vest, is only wounded.\\nDoc meets with Beynon, not realizing he had arranged a double-cross wherein Carol would sneak into the meet and kill Doc; however, Carol turns her gun on Beynon and shoots him dead. Doc, having just been taunted by Beynon before Carol shot him, realizes that Carol had sex with Beynon to secure his parole. He angrily gathers up the money and, after a bitter quarrel, the couple flees for the border at El Paso.\\nRudy forces rural veterinarian Harold Clinton and his wife Fran to treat his injuries, then kidnaps the pair to pursue Doc and Carol. Beynon\\'s brother Cully and his team also track the McCoys down. At a train station, a con man swaps locker keys with Carol and steals their bag of money. Doc follows him onto a train and forcibly takes it back, although the con man has already pocketed a packet of the money. The injured con man and a train passenger—a boy whom Doc had rebuked for squirting him with a water gun—are taken to the police station, where they identify Doc\\'s mug shot.\\nCarol buys a car, and the McCoys drive to an electronics store. As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches off the radio set near the proprietor\\'s desk broadcasting the news of the earlier incidents they were involved in. When all the television sets in the store show Doc\\'s picture, he leaves immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse of the picture and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun from a neighboring store, and shoots up the police car so that they can flee.\\nThe mutual attraction between Rudy and Fran, the veterinarian\\'s wife, leads to them having consensual sex on two occasions in front of her husband, who is tied up in a chair. Humiliated, the vet hangs himself in the motel bathroom. Rudy and Fran move on, barely acknowledging the suicide. They check into an El Paso hotel used by criminals as a safe house because Rudy knows that the McCoys will be heading to the same place. When Doc and Carol check in at the hotel, they ask for food to be delivered, but the manager, Laughlin, says he is working alone and cannot leave the desk. Doc realizes that Laughlin sent his family away because something is about to happen. He urges Carol to dress quickly so they can escape. An armed Rudy comes to their door while Fran poses as a delivery girl. Peering from an adjacent doorway, Doc is surprised to see Rudy alive. He sneaks up behind Rudy, knocks him out, and does the same to Fran.\\nBeynon\\'s brother and his thugs arrive as the McCoys try to leave. A violent gunfight ensues in the halls, stairwell, and elevator and all but one of Cully\\'s men are killed; Doc allows him to run away. Rudy comes to, follows Doc and Carol outside onto a fire escape, and shoots at them. Doc returns fire and kills him. With the police on the way, the couple hijack a pickup truck and force the driver, a cooperative old cowboy, to take them to Mexico. After crossing the border, Doc and Carol pay the cowboy $30,000 for his truck. Overjoyed, the cowboy heads back to El Paso on foot, while the couple continue into Mexico, having gotten away with their crimes, and the remainder of the money.\\n'},\n",

Ruddy, and starring Burt Reynolds, Eddie Albert, Ed Lauter, and Mike Conrad. The film was released as \"The Mean Machine\" in the United Kingdom. The film follows a former NFL player recruiting a group of prisoners and playing football against their guards. It features many real-life football players, including Green Bay Packers legend Ray Nitschke.[4]\\nThe film has been remade three times: as the 2001 British film Mean Machine (a shortened version of the title used for the original\\'s UK release), starring Vinnie Jones, the 2005 film remake, The Longest Yard featuring Adam Sandler and Reynolds as coach Nate Scarborough, and as the 2015 Egyptian film Captain Masr. In the two international remakes from 2001 and 2015, the sport was changed from gridiron football to Association Football.\\n\\nPlot: Former star pro football quarterback Paul \"Wrecking\" Crewe walks out on his wealthy girlfriend Melissa in Palm Beach, Florida. After taking her Maserati-engined Citroën SM without permission and leading police on a car chase, and subsequent attack of two police officers, Crewe is sentenced to 18 months in Citrus State Prison.\\nThe convicts disrespect Crewe because he was dismissed from the NFL for point shaving. The warden, Rudolph Hazen, is a football fanatic who manages a semi-pro team of prison guards. He wants Crewe to help coach the team and clinch a championship. Responding to pressure from the head guard and coach, Captain Wilhelm Knauer, a reluctant Crewe eventually agrees to play in an exhibition game. Crewe forms a prison team that includes Samson, a former professional weightlifter, and Connie Shokner, a killer and martial arts expert.\\nAided by the clever Caretaker, former professional player Nate Scarboro and the first black inmate willing to play, \"Granny\" Granville, plus long-term prisoner Pop—and the warden\\'s amorous secretary, Miss Toot—Crewe molds a team nicknamed the \"Mean Machine\". He agrees to play quarterback himself. After witnessing \"Granny\" being harassed by some of the prison guards without breaking, the black inmates decide to volunteer their services and join the team. Unger, one of the prison trustees, persistently asks Crewe if he can replace Caretaker as manager of the team, which Crewe refuses to do. In retaliation, Unger attempts to kill Crewe by fashioning a homemade bomb from a light bulb filled with a combustible fluid, designed to detonate inside Crewe\\'s cell when he turns on the light. Caretaker is killed instead when he enters Crewe\\'s cell to retrieve some papers; Unger locks the cell door, preventing rescue. Hazen sternly lectures Crewe\\'s teammates about the consequences of any attempted escape after the game. Afterward, Crewe re-energizes the team with a surprise - presenting them with professional uniforms (stolen from the guards by Caretaker before he was killed). They charge onto the field in their new uniforms, angering the guards and Hazen.\\nThe \"Mean Machine\" starts out well, and at halftime the game is close: the guards lead 15-13. Hazen threatens Crewe as an accessory to Caretaker\\'s murder unless Crewe loses the game to the guards by at least 21 points. Crewe reluctantly agrees, but only if Hazen promises not to hurt the other prisoners; Hazen agrees, but he betrays him by telling Knauer to have his team \"inflict as much physical punishment on the prisoners as humanly possible\" as soon as they are ahead by 21 points. Knauer, certain that the guards would win, reluctantly complies. Crewe makes deliberate mistakes, putting the \"Mean Machine\" down by more than three touchdowns, 35-13, then takes himself out of the game. The guards gladly injure several of the prisoners, and Crewe\\'s teammates feel betrayed.\\nDepressed, Crewe asks Pop if it was worth punching Hazen (who was a guard when Pop was younger) and spending 30 years in prison; he says it was worth it and this rejuvenates Crewe. He goes back into the game, but the prisoners refuse to cooperate with him until he convinces them of his change of heart. The \"Mean Machine\" gets back into the game, trailing 35-30, one of their touchdowns scored by Nate despite his bad knee, and he is immediately cut down and crippled by guard Bogdanski. As he is wheeled off the field, Nate tells Crewe to \"screw Hazen\" and win the game. Crewe takes Bogdanski out of the game by twice throwing the ball with full force into Bogdanski\\'s genital area. Crewe scores the winning touchdown with no time left and the \"Mean Machine\" wins, 36-35.\\nAs the prisoners celebrate, Crewe walks across the field towards the departing crowds. Hazen repeatedly orders Knauer to shoot him because he thinks Crewe is trying to escape. Knauer hesitates due to his newfound respect for Crewe, who is actually retrieving a football. Disgusted at what he almost did, Knauer hands the rifle back to Hazen saying, \"Game ball.\" Crewe returns to the crestfallen Hazen with the ball telling him, \"Stick this in your trophy case.\" Crewe walks into the stadium tunnel with Pop who says \"I knew you could do it!\"\\n'},\n",

The 49th Disney animated feature film, it is inspired in part by the 2002 novel The Frog Princess by E. D. Baker, which in turn is based on the German folk tale \"The Frog Prince\" as collected by the Brothers Grimm. The film was directed by John Musker and Ron Clements and produced by Peter Del Vecho, from a screenplay that Musker and Clements co-wrote with Rob Edwards. The directors also co-wrote the story with the writing team of Greg Erb and Jason Oremland. \\nThe film stars the voices of Anika Noni Rose, Bruno Campos, Michael-Leon Wooley, Jim Cummings, Jennifer Cody, John Goodman, Keith David, Peter Bartlett, Jenifer Lewis, Oprah Winfrey, and Terrence Howard. Set in New Orleans during the 1920s, the film tells the story of a hardworking waitress named Tiana who dreams of opening her own restaurant. After kissing a prince who has been turned into a frog by an evil witch doctor, Tiana becomes a frog herself and must find a way to turn back into a human before it is too late.\\nThe Princess and the Frog began production in July 2006, under the working title The Frog Princess. It marked Disney\\'s brief return to traditional animation, as it was the mainstream animation studio\\'s first traditionally animated film since Home on the Range (2004). Musker and Clements, directors of Disney\\'s The Great Mouse Detective (1986), The Little Mermaid (1989), Aladdin (1992), Hercules (1997), and Treasure Planet (2002) returned to Disney to direct The Princess and the Frog. The studio returned to a Broadway musical-style format frequently used during the Disney Renaissance, and the film features a score and songs written, composed, and conducted by Randy Newman, well known for his musical involvement in Pixar films such as the Toy Story franchise.\\nThe Princess and the Frog premiered at the Roy E. Disney Animation Building on the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank on November 15, 2009, and first opened in a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on November 25, followed by its wide release on December 11. The film received largely positive reviews from critics, who praised the animation (particularly the revival of the hand-drawn form), characters, music, voice acting (particularly David\\'s), and themes; however, it was criticized for its depiction of Louisiana Voodoo and alleged historical negationism of its depiction of the Southern United States during the Jim Crow era. It was a qualified success at the box office: it somewhat underperformed Disney\\'s targets yet finished in first place in North America on its opening weekend and grossed around $271 million worldwide (becoming, in the process, Disney’s most successful traditionally animated film since Lilo & Stitch in 2002). It received three Oscar nominations at the 82nd Academy Awards: one for Best Animated Feature and two for Best Original Song.[4]\\n\\nPlot: Set in the Roaring Twenties in New Orleans, Tiana is completely devoted to opening her own restaurant, a dream she shared with her late father, who died in World War I. She works two waitress jobs every day and night to earn money to make this dream a reality, leaving her no time for a social life. \\nMeanwhile, Naveen, the spoiled and arrogant prince of Maldonia, arrives in New Orleans, where, being financially cut off from his family\\'s fortune by his parents, he intends to marry the rich Southern belle   Charlotte La Bouff, who is known  to be Tiana\\'s best friend. Her father, wealthy Eli \"Big Daddy\" La Bouff, hosts a masquerade ball in Naveen\\'s honor, for which Charlotte hires Tiana to make beignets, offering her enough to buy a dilapidated mill to convert into her dream restaurant. Naveen and his valet, Lawrence, encounter Dr. Facilier, a voodoo witch doctor, who tricks them into a fortune reading. Then, he transforms Naveen into a frog and gives Lawrence Naveen\\'s appearance through a voodoo talisman containing Naveen\\'s blood. Facilier intends for the disguised Lawrence to marry Charlotte, then to kill her father with a voodoo doll so he can gain the La Bouff fortune.\\nAt the ball, Tiana is told by the realtors, the Fenner Brothers, that she has been outbid for the mill. Despondent, Tiana wishes on the evening star for her dream to come true. She then meets Naveen in frog form who, believing her to be a princess, asks for a kiss to break Facilier\\'s spell. Tiana reluctantly accepts after Naveen promises to finance her restaurant. However, Tiana transforms into a frog because she is not a princess. The two are chased into a bayou where they meet a trumpet-playing alligator named Louis, who dreams of playing jazz. After informing Louis they are actually humans under a voodoo spell, he tells them of Mama Odie, another voodoo practitioner who lives in the bayou and they all go in search of her.\\nThey are guided to Mama Odie by a Cajun firefly named Ray, who is enamored with the Evening Star, believing it is a firefly named \"Evangeline,\" as no one has the heart to tell him otherwise. During the journey, Tiana and Naveen fend off a group of hunters and begin developing feelings for each other, especially after the latter learns to be a more responsible human being. Meanwhile, the talisman disguising Lawrence as Naveen needs more of Naveen\\'s blood or Lawrence will return to his normal appearance. Discovering Naveen has escaped, Facilier asks his \"friends on the other side\" (a legion of voodoo spirits) to help retrieve him, offering them the souls of the people of New Orleans in exchange, and they grant him an army of shadow demons to do his bidding. The demons discover Tiana and her group in the bayou, although they are rescued by Mama Odie.\\nMama Odie tells Naveen the spell can only be broken with a princess\\'s kiss. They realize that as Big Daddy has been crowned Mardi Gras king, Charlotte will be a princess until midnight. The group hitches a ride on a paddle steamer back to New Orleans, during which Naveen tells Ray about his love for Tiana and plans to propose marriage to her, although after talking to her, he selflessly decides against it since transforming him and Tiana into humans and financing Tiana\\'s restaurant is contingent on him kissing and marrying Charlotte. The shadow demons find and capture Naveen and bring him to Facilier, who uses his blood to replenish the talisman. After hearing from Ray how Naveen feels about her, Tiana heads to the Mardi Gras parade to find him, only to see Lawrence, masquerading as Naveen, marrying Charlotte. Heartbroken and now believing she will forever be a frog, Tiana flees the scene.\\nRay rescues the real Naveen and steals the talisman, which he gives to Tiana before Facilier mortally wounds him. Facilier offers to make Tiana\\'s dream come true in exchange for the talisman. Realizing she would rather be with Naveen and that she would be dishonoring her father by accepting, Tiana destroys it. With Facilier\\'s plan foiled, the former voodoo spirits accomplice drag him into their world for failing to pay back his debt. After Lawrence is exposed and arrested, Tiana reveals her love to Naveen and Charlotte agrees to kiss Naveen so he and Tiana can be human, but the clock strikes midnight and the kiss fails. Ray dies shortly thereafter and during his funeral a new star appears next to Evangeline. Tiana and Naveen are married by Madam Odie, and since doing so makes Tiana a princess, both are restored to human form after their kiss. They later return to New Orleans to legally marry and open their restaurant together, with Louis playing in the band.\\n'},\n",

Nawal\\'s will makes reference to not keeping a promise, denying her a proper gravestone and casket, unless Jeanne and Simon track down their mysterious brother, whose existence they were previously unaware of, and their father, who they believed was dead. Nawal has left two letters; one is to be delivered to Jeanne and Simon\\'s father, and the other is to be delivered to their brother. Jeanne accepts; Simon, on the other hand, seemingly having had a more difficult relationship with Nawal and her apparently unusual personality, is reluctant to join Jeanne on this pursuit.\\nA series of flashbacks reveal Nawal came from a Christian Arab family in an unnamed Levantine country, and that she fell in love with a refugee named Wahab, resulting in her pregnancy. Her family murders her lover and nearly shoots her as an honour killing, but her grandmother spares her, making her promise to leave the village after the birth of her baby and start a new life in the fictional city of Daresh. The grandmother tattoos the back of the baby\\'s heel and sends him to an orphanage.\\nWhile Nawal is at university in Daresh, a civil war and war crimes break out with Nawal opposing the war on human rights grounds. Her son\\'s orphanage in Kfar Khout is destroyed by a Muslim militant, Chamseddine, who converts him into an Islamic child soldier. After barely escaping the massacre of a bus full of Muslim refugees by Christian Nationalists, Nawal narrowly manages to join the Muslim fighters, and eventually shoots a nationalist leader. She is imprisoned in Kfar Ryat and raped by torturer Abou Tarek, consequently giving birth to the twins.\\nAfter travelling to her mother\\'s native country, Jeanne gradually uncovers this past, and persuades Simon to join her.

Simon meets with him personally, and he reveals the war-mad Nihad was captured by the nationalists, turned by them, trained as a torturer, and then sent to Kfar Ryat, where he took the name Abou Tarek, making him both the twins\\' half-brother and father; as such, both letters are addressed to the same person. Like Nawal, Nihad\\'s superiors gave him a new life in Canada after the war. By chance, Nawal encountered him at a Canadian swimming pool, and saw both the tattoo and his face.

A co-production between Germany and Austria, it stars Daniel Brühl, Stipe Erceg, and Julia Jentsch as three young, anti-capitalist Berlin activists involved in a love triangle. The friends, calling themselves \"the Edukators\",[b] invade upper-class houses, rearrange the furniture, and leave notes identifying themselves. Weingartner, a former activist, wrote the film based on his experiences and chose to use nonviolent characters. The film, shot in Berlin and Austria with digital hand-held cameras, was made on a low budget which Weingartner said kept the focus on the acting.\\nFirst shown at the Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2004 and released in its home countries later that year, The Edukators was praised by critics and audiences. It grossed more than US$8\\xa0million worldwide and received a number of awards and nominations. It did, however, receive criticism mainly for its political statements and also for its long running time. It has become a cult film, part of a \"German New Wave\", and the inspiration for real-life actions and a 2013 stage adaptation in Brazil.\\n\\nPlot: Set in 2004, the film revolves around three young anti-capitalist activists in Berlin\\'s city centre: Jule (Julia Jentsch), her boyfriend Peter (Stipe Erceg) and his best friend Jan (Daniel Brühl). Jule is a waitress struggling to pay off a €100,000 debt she incurred a year ago when she crashed into a Mercedes-Benz S-Class belonging to a wealthy businessman named Hardenberg (Burghart Klaußner). After her eviction for non-payment of rent, she moves in with Peter and Jan, who are often out all night. While Peter is in Barcelona, Jan tells Jule that he and Peter spend their nights \"educating\" upper-class people by breaking into their houses, moving furniture around and leaving notes saying \"die fetten Jahre sind vorbei\" (\"the days of plenty are over\") or \"Sie haben zu viel Geld\" (\"you have too much money\").\\nAfter hearing this, Jule convinces the reluctant Jan to break into Hardenberg\\'s home in the affluent Berlin suburb of Zehlendorf while he is away on business. During the break-in, the thrill of the moment entices them to kiss before Jan leaves Jule alone for a few minutes; he does not want to destroy his friendship with Peter. As she wanders around outside Jule accidentally sets off the house\\'s floodlights, and they quickly leave.\\nWhen Peter returns the next day, Jan and Jule do not tell him about their activities the night before. Jule realises that her mobile phone is gone, and she and Jan leave later that night to look for it in the house. After she finds it, Hardenberg walks in the door and struggles with Jule when he recognises her. Hearing them, Jan comes downstairs and knocks Hardenberg unconscious with a flashlight. Not knowing what to do, they call Peter and he comes to their aid.\\nThe three cannot decide what to do with Hardenberg and take him to a remote, rarely used cabin belonging to Jule\\'s uncle in the Tyrolean Austrian Alps near Jenbach, overlooking Achensee. As they try to decide how to deal with their hostage, they learn that Hardenberg was a radical himself during the 1960s. A leader of the Socialist German Student Union, he was a good friend of Rudi Dutschke before marrying, getting a good job and abandoning his ideals.\\nAs the story progresses, political ideology and the characters\\' relationships become the main issues. Peter and Jan temporarily fall out over Jan\\'s developing romance with Jule, and Hardenberg seems to regain some of his former self.\\nThe trio finally decides that kidnapping Hardenberg was wrong and take him back to his house to let him go. As they prepare to leave, Hardenberg gives Jule a letter forgiving her debt and promising not to involve the police. The film ends with Peter, Jan and Jule asleep in the same bed as a group of heavily armed police (Spezialeinsatzkommando)[c] gather outside their flat and knock on the door. Jule wakes up when she hears a knock, and the police force their way into the almost-empty flat. Apparently in Barcelona, Jule opens the door to a hotel maid who wishes to clean their room. In the Berlin apartment, the police find a note: \"Manche Menschen ändern sich nie\" (\"some people never change\"). In the original German version, the Edukators set off in Hardenberg\\'s boat in the Mediterranean, presumably to disrupt the island signal towers supplying most television programming to Western Europe.[d]\\n'},\n",

The storyline revolves around two survivors of a shipwreck who are on a lifeboat stranded in the Pacific Ocean for 227 days. One is a sixteen-year-old Indian boy named Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) and the other is a ferocious Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.\\nThe film began development shortly after the release of the book and would see directors M. Night Shyamalan, Alfonso Cuarón and Jean-Pierre Jeunet involved at various stages before the hiring of Lee. Filming was split between India, Taiwan and Montreal in 2011, with Rhythm & Hues Studios (R&H) handling the visual effects work.\\nThe film had its worldwide premiere as the opening film of the 50th New York Film Festival at both the Walter Reade Theater and Alice Tully Hall in New York City on September 28, 2012. It was theatrically released in the U.S. on November 21 by 20th Century Fox. Life of Pi became a commercial success, having grossed over $609 million. Critics praised Lee\\'s direction, the screenplay, the editing, the music, the sound design and especially the effects and the cinematography. It was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, including Best Picture – Drama and Best Director, and won for Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. At the 85th Academy Awards it had eleven nominations, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, and won four, including Best Director for Ang Lee.\\n\\nPlot: In Canada a writer meets Pi Patel, who he has been told would be a good subject for a book. Pi tells the writer the following story:\\nPi\\'s father names him Piscine Molitor Patel after Piscine Molitor, a famous French swimming pool. In secondary school in Pondicherry, he adopts the Greek letter \"Pi\" as his nickname to avoid bullying. He is raised in a polytheistic Hindu family, but at 12 years old, he is introduced to Christianity and then Islam, and decides to follow all three religions as he \"just wants to love God\". His mother supports his desire to grow, but his rationalist father tries to secularize him. Pi\\'s family owns a zoo, and Pi takes interest in a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. After Pi gets dangerously close to Richard Parker, his father forces him to witness the tiger killing a goat.\\nWhen Pi is 16, his father announces that due to \"The Emergency\", they must move to Canada, where he intends to settle and sell the animals. The family books passage with the animals on a Japanese freighter. During a storm, the ship founders while Pi is on deck. He struggles to find his family, but a crewman throws him into a lifeboat. A freed plains zebra jumps onto the boat with him, breaking its leg. The ship sinks into the Mariana Trench, drowning his family. \\nAfter the storm, Pi awakens in the lifeboat with the zebra and is joined by a bornean orangutan. A spotted hyena emerges from under a tarpaulin, forcing Pi to retreat to the end of the boat. The hyena kills the zebra and later the orangutan. Richard Parker suddenly comes out from under the tarpaulin, killing the hyena before retreating back to cover.\\nPi fashions a small raft which he tethers to the lifeboat to be safe from Richard Parker. Despite his moral code against killing, he begins fishing, enabling him to sustain the tiger. When the tiger jumps into the sea to hunt for fish and then swims toward Pi, Pi considers letting him drown, but ultimately helps him into the boat. One night, a humpback whale destroys the raft and its supplies. Pi trains Richard Parker to accept him in the boat and realizes that caring for the tiger is helping to keep himself alive.\\nWeeks later, they encounter a floating island. It is a lush jungle of edible plants, freshwater pools and a large population of meerkats, enabling Pi and Richard Parker to eat, drink and regain strength. At night, the island transforms into a hostile environment. Richard Parker retreats to the lifeboat while Pi and the meerkats sleep in the trees; the water pools turn acidic. Pi deduces that the island is carnivorous after finding a human tooth embedded in a flower.\\nPi and Richard Parker leave the island, reaching Mexico after over 200 days at sea. Pi is heartbroken that Richard Parker does not acknowledge him before disappearing into the jungle. While Pi recovers in a hospital, insurance agents for the Japanese freighter company interview him, but do not believe his story and ask what really happened, specifically concerning why the ship sank. He tells a different story, in which the animals are replaced by humans: his mother for the orangutan, an amiable Buddhist sailor for the zebra, the ship\\'s brutish cook for the hyena, and Pi himself for Richard Parker. The cook kills the sailor and feeds on his flesh. He then kills Pi\\'s mother, after which Pi kills him and uses his remains as food and fish bait. The insurance agents are dissatisfied with this story but leave without questioning Pi further.\\nWhen the writer recognizes the animal story may be an allegory for the human story, Pi says that it does not matter which story is true because his family died either way, and neither story provides the explanation the insurance company wanted. He asks which story the author prefers, and the author chooses the first, to which Pi replies, \"and so it goes with God\". Glancing at a copy of the insurance report, the writer reads that Pi survived his adventure \"in the company of an adult Bengal tiger.\"\\n'},\n",

It premiered on 1 December 2003 at the Embassy Theatre in Wellington, and was then released on 17 December 2003 in the US and on 18 December 2003 in New Zealand. The film was acclaimed by both critics and audiences, who considered it to be a landmark in filmmaking and the fantasy film genre, and a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, with praise for the visual effects, performances, action sequences, direction, screenplay, musical score, costume design, emotional depth and scope. It grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2003 and the second highest-grossing film of all time at the time of release, as well as the highest-grossing film ever released by New Line Cinema.[5]\\nLike the previous films in the trilogy, The Return of the King is widely recognised as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made.

It also became the second film series whose entries have all won Best Visual Effects, after the original Star Wars trilogy.\\n\\nPlot: The hobbit, Sméagol, is fishing with his cousin Déagol, who discovers the One Ring in the river. Sméagol's mind is ensnared by the Ring, and he kills his cousin for it. Increasingly corrupted physically and mentally, he retreats into the Misty Mountains and becomes known as Gollum.\\nCenturies later, during the War of the Ring, Gandalf leads Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and King Théoden of Rohan to Isengard, where they reunite with Merry and Pippin. Gandalf retrieves Saruman's palantír, and the group returns to Edoras to celebrate their victory at Helm's Deep.[a] Pippin looks into the palantír, seeing Sauron and a burning tree. Gandalf deduces that the enemy plans to attack Gondor's capital Minas Tirith; he rides there to warn Gondor's steward Denethor. Pippin, who accompanies him, swears fealty to Denethor, whose now-dead heir Boromir had saved his life;[b] on Gandalf's instruction, Pippin triggers the lighting of the beacons, which call for help from Rohan.\\nFrodo, who carries the Ring, and Sam continue their journey towards Mordor, unaware that Gollum, now their guide, plans to betray them and take the Ring for himself. The trio witnessed the Witch-king of Angmar, lord of the nine Nazgûl, setting off towards Gondor with his army of Orcs. Gollum conspires to frame Sam for eating food supplies and desiring the Ring; influenced by the growing power of the Ring, Frodo is taken in by the deception, and orders Sam to go home. Gollum then tricks Frodo into venturing into the lair of the giant spider Shelob. Frodo narrowly escapes and confronts Gollum, who falls down a chasm after a scuffle. Shelob discovers, paralyses, and binds Frodo, but is wounded and driven away by a returning Sam, who, mourning Frodo's apparent death, takes the Ring. Sam realises his mistake when a group of Orcs takes Frodo captive but manages to rescue Frodo as the Orcs fight among themselves. Now inside Mordor, the hobbits continue towards Mount Doom, their destination.\\nAs King Théoden gathers his army, Elrond tells Aragorn that Arwen is dying, having refused to leave Middle-earth. Elrond gives Aragorn Andúril, reforged from the shards of King Elendil's sword Narsil, and urges him to commit to claiming Gondor's throne, to which he is the heir. Joined by Legolas and Gimli, Aragorn travels the Paths of the Dead, and pledges to release the ghosts there from their curse should they come to Gondor's aid. Meanwhile, Faramir, who was earlier overwhelmed and driven back to Minas Tirith by the Witch-king, is gravely wounded in a suicide charge; believing his son to be dead, Denethor falls into madness. Gandalf marshals the defenders, but the huge Orc army breaks into the city. Denethor attempts to burn himself and Faramir on a pyre, but Pippin alerts Gandalf and they rescue Faramir. Denethor, set ablaze and in agony, jumps to his death.\\nThéoden arrives and leads his army against the Orcs. Despite initial success against Orcs in the ensuing battle, they are decimated by the Oliphaunt-riding Haradrim and the Witch-king mortally wounds Théoden; however, his niece Éowyn slays the Witch-king with Merry's help. Théoden dies in his niece's arms. Aragorn then arrives with his Army of the Dead, who overcome Sauron's forces. Their oath is fulfilled, and the Dead are released from their curse. Aragorn decides to march on Mordor to distract Sauron from Frodo, now extremely weak, and Sam; all of Sauron's remaining forces march to meet Aragorn's diversion, allowing the hobbits to reach Mount Doom. Gollum, who survived his earlier fall, attacks them, but Frodo still manages to enter the mountain. There, he succumbs to the Ring's power, putting it on his finger, but Gollum manages to bite off his finger and reclaim it. They struggle together and both fall off the ledge. Frodo clings to it with one hand as remorse and guilt flood his mind in the wake of his succumbing to the ring when Sam's unwavering faith and belief in his friend convinces him to make one final reach for Sam's hand, saving Frodo's life. Gollum falls and dies; the Ring, which fell with him, disintegrates in the lava, causing Barad-dûr to crumble as The Eye of Sauron explodes, destroying the dark lord once and for all. Aragorn's army emerges victorious as its enemies and the lands of Mordor collapse into the earth, and Mount Doom erupts, with Frodo and Sam narrowly escaping the lava.\\nGandalf rescues the hobbits with the help of eagles, and the surviving Fellowship is happily reunited in Minas Tirith. Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor and marries Arwen. The Hobbits return home to the Shire, where Sam marries Rosie Cotton. Four years later, Frodo, whose wound inflicted by the Witch-king refuses to heal and suffering from trauma, departs Middle-earth for the Undying Lands with his uncle Bilbo, Gandalf, and the Elves. He leaves Sam the Red Book of Westmarch, which details their adventures. Sam returns to the Shire, where he embraces Rosie and their children.\\n\"},\n",

Hannibal escapes and sets out to rescue his friend Templeton \"Face\" Peck, who is held captive at Tuco\\'s ranch. Hannibal saves Face after enlisting former Ranger B.A. Baracus, driving to the rescue in B.A.\\'s modified GMC Vandura. Pursued by Tuco, they stop at a nearby Army hospital to recruit the services of a pilot Howling Mad Murdock. They flee in a medical helicopter, and are being chased by Tuco in a dogfight. They lure Tuco\\'s helicopter into American airspace where it is shot down by an fighter jet for trespassing, killing Tuco.\\nEight years later in Iraq, Hannibal is contacted by CIA Special Activities Division operative Lynch, who assigns them on a black operation to recover U.S. Treasury plates and over $1 billion in cash slated to move out of Baghdad in an armored convoy. Hannibal\\'s commanding officer, General Morrison, consents to the operation but Face\\'s former girlfriend, Defense Criminal Investigative Service Capt. Charissa Sosa, tries to discourage the team from getting the plates. The mission is successful, but when the team returns to base, both the money and Morrison\\'s vehicle are destroyed by Brock Pike and his men from the private security firm Black Forest. Without Morrison, the only proof that they were authorized to act, Hannibal, Face, Murdock, and B.A. are court-martialed, sentenced to ten years in separate prisons, and dishonorably discharged. Because the plates were her responsibility, Sosa is demoted to lieutenant.\\nSix months later, Lynch visits Hannibal in prison and tells him that Pike may be trying to sell the plates with the help of an Arab backer. Hannibal, who has been tracking Pike on his own, makes a deal with Lynch: full reinstatement and clean records for his team in return for the plates. Lynch agrees and Hannibal escapes, breaking out Face, B.A., and Murdock in the process. The team hijacks a C-130, which is later destroyed by Reaper UCAVs, but not before the team parachutes away in an M8 light tank stashed aboard and make it to the ground safely. The team moves to reclaim the plates and are able to kidnap Pike\\'s backer. It is revealed that the backer is actually General Morrison in disguise, who plotted with Lynch and Pike to steal the plates but teamed up with Pike to double-cross Lynch and fake his death. Lynch orders an airstrike to kill the team and Morrison, but the team manages to escape while Morrison was killed in the explosion.\\nHannibal arranges to meet Sosa on board a container ship at the Port of Los Angeles, saying he will hand over \"Morrison\" and the plates. Face then calls Sosa and conspires a different plan with her. It all unfolds according to plan until Pike, who is now working with Lynch, blows up the container ship with a rocket launcher and chases Face in a ensuing gunfight. B.A. confronts Pike before breaking his neck, killing him and saving Face\\'s life. Hannibal leads Lynch into a container with Murdock, who, wearing a covered bullet-proof helmet filled with ketchup, is portraying Morrison. Lynch shoots at Murdock\\'s head, and believing that he has killed Morrison, is later tricked into admitting that he stole the plates and is subsequently caught and arrested by Sosa for his crimes.\\nCIA agents led by a separate \"Lynch\" come and claim custody of the original one. Despite their success and proving themselves innocent, the military still arrests the team for escaping from federal prison, which is a criminal offense. Sosa is reinstated to captain, but she promises to do all she can to set the team free and kisses Face as everybody is led into a prison van.\\nIn the van, the team starts saying that the system has burned them again, but Hannibal tells them that there is always a way out of any situation, and turns towards Face, who smiles and opens his mouth, revealing a handcuff key given to him by Sosa through the kiss.\\n'},\n",

At the town bar, he is attacked by a gang of bikers but swiftly kills them all. Impressed, Carnegie invites Eli to join his employ, but Eli declines.

They row to Alcatraz Island, where they find a group intent on preserving what remains of literature and music. Eli tells the guards that he has a copy of the Bible. Taken inside, Eli dictates the New King James Version of the Bible from memory to Lombardi, the sanctuary's leader.[7][6]\\nIn the town, Carnegie discovers Eli's bible is in Braille, revealing Eli to be blind. Claudia, feigning ignorance of Braille, tells Carnegie that his leg wound has become infected and the loss of his enforcers has led the people to run amok.

He brings David back to the warehouse, where David argues he has the right to choose his own path through life, but Thompson says humans only have the appearance of free will, as the Bureau\\'s experiments with withdrawing their influence resulted in the Dark Ages and the horrors of the first half of the twentieth century, respectively. Thompson tells David that being with Elise will keep him from his fate of becoming President of the United States, and being with David will keep Elise from becoming a world-famous dancer and choreographer.

Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage), a \"Merlinean\", is a sorcerer in modern-day Manhattan, fighting against the forces of evil, in particular his nemesis, Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina), while searching for the person who will eventually inherit Merlin\\'s powers (\"The Prime Merlinean\"). This turns out to be Dave Stutler (Jay Baruchel), a physics student, whom Balthazar takes as a reluctant protégé.

Horvath betrays his master by joining forces with the evil sorceress Morgana le Fay. Morgana mortally wounds Merlin before Veronica is able to rip Morgana\\'s soul from her body and absorbs it into her own. As Morgana attempts to kill Veronica by possessing her from within, Balthazar stops her by imprisoning Morgana and Veronica in the \"Grimhold\", a magic prison in the shape of a nesting doll. Before dying, Merlin gives Balthazar a dragon figurine that will identify the Prime Merlinean, Merlin\\'s descendant and the only one able to defeat Morgana. While he searches for his descendant throughout history, Balthazar imprisons Morganians, sorcerers who try to release Morgana, including Horvath, into successive layers on the Grimhold.\\nIn 2000, in New York City, the Prime Merlinean is revealed to be 10-year-old Dave Stutler, who encounters Balthazar in his Manhattan antique store, after straying from his school field trip. When Balthazar gives Dave Merlin\\'s dragon figurine, the statue comes to life and wraps itself around the boy\\'s finger to form a ring. When Balthazar goes to retrieve a book meant to teach magic, Dave accidentally opens the Grimhold, releasing the imprisoned Horvath. While battling for possession of the Grimhold, Balthazar and Horvath are imprisoned in an ancient Chinese urn with a ten-year lock curse. Dave is then ridiculed by his classmates when he claims he saw magic, only to find the shop empty. He is faced with severe bullying, and is misdiagnosed with hallucination caused by a \"glucose imbalance\", whilst nevertheless keeping the ring.\\nTen years later, Dave, now 20 years old, is a physics student at New York University, and meets his childhood crush Becky. He immediately becomes smitten with her, and repairs the transmitting mast of the radio station she works at after it is struck by lightning. The ten-year imprisonment curse of the urn ends, releasing Horvath and Balthazar. Horvath pursues Dave and the Grimhold. Balthazar rescues Dave, riding an animated steel eagle adapted from a Chrysler Building gargoyle. Dave initially refuses to help Balthazar, having been under psychiatric care since their first meeting, until Balthazar agrees to leave after finding the Grimhold. They track the Grimhold to Chinatown, where Horvath has released the next Morganian, Sun Lok. Dave defeats Sun Lok, and Balthazar retrieves the Grimhold. Dave changes his mind, deciding that he likes magic after all, and agrees to become Balthazar\\'s apprentice. He also becomes romantically involved with Becky against Balthazar\\'s wishes and advice, impressing her by playing the OneRepublic song \"Secrets\" with the Tesla coils he has been experimenting with.\\nHorvath enlists a youthful Morganian, celebrity magician Drake Stone to get back the Grimhold. They attempt to kill Dave, but Balthazar saves him. Cued by Horvath, Dave demands to know the truth about Balthazar\\'s quest. Balthazar reveals that Morgana is trapped in the Grimhold with Veronica. Morgana, if freed, would cast a spell called \"The Rising\", which would revive sorcerers from the dead and enslave mankind. As Prime Merlinian, Dave will become powerful enough to cast spells without his ring (a focus, which for any other magician is the only way to channel their magic), and is the only one who can stop her. Despite Balthazar\\'s disdain of his relationship with Becky, Dave convinces him to allow him to meet her for a date. Dave tries to use magic to clean his lab, but loses control of his animated cleaning mops, which forces him to cancel his date with Becky. He is saved because of Balthazar\\'s intervention and, disillusioned, decides to give up on magic, until Becky unknowingly changes his mind. He returns to his underground subway lab, just as Drake and Horvath try to kill Balthazar and steal the Grimhold. Horvath, having no more use for Drake, casts a parasite spell and steals Drake\\'s magic and his ring.\\nHorvath releases the witch Abigail Williams, uses her to kidnap Becky at the radio station, then steals her magic and pendant focus. He threatens to kill Becky, therefore forcing Dave to surrender the Grimhold and his ring. Balthazar goes after Horvath in Battery Park, sure that Dave, without his ring, will be killed. Horvath releases Morgana, who begins the Rising Spell while Horvath animates the Charging Bull sculpture and commands it to attack Balthazar. Dave arrives and stuns Horvath with a Tesla coil tied to Balthazar\\'s car while Balthazar\\'s eagle flies away with the bull. Becky disrupts the Rising Spell, stunning Morgana. Balthazar takes Morgana, body and soul, from Veronica into himself, but Morgana escapes and tries to incinerate them. Dave attempts to stop her without his ring and succeeds, proving that he is the Prime Merlinean. Morgana shoots plasma bolts at the three and overwhelming Balthazar and Veronica\\'s shield spells, kills Balthazar when he bodily intercepts a bolt meant for Veronica. Dave makes another, larger Tesla coil out of the square\\'s lamp posts and power lines to overwhelm her and then fires a plasma barrage, which finally destroys her. He revives Balthazar by restarting his heart with plasma shocks, and Balthazar reunites with Veronica. Dave and Becky kiss, and fly to France for breakfast on Balthazar\\'s eagle.\\nIn a post-credits scene, Horvath retrieves his hat from Balthazar\\'s shop.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'The Chorus (French: Les Choristes, literally \"The Choristers\" or \"The Choirboys\") is a 2004 French musical drama film directed by Christophe Barratier. Co-written by Barratier and Philippe Lopes-Curval, it is an adaptation of the 1945 film A Cage of Nightingales (La Cage aux rossignols). The story is inspired by the origin of the boys\\' choir the Little Singers of Paris.\\nAt the 77th Academy Awards, The Chorus was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Song (the latter for \"Vois sur ton chemin\", listed as \"Look to Your Path\", composed by Bruno Coulais).\\n\\nPlot: In 2004, Pierre Morhange (Jacques Perrin), a French conductor performing in the United States, is informed before a concert that his mother has died. After the performance he returns to his home in France for her funeral. An old friend named Pépinot (Didier Flamand) arrives at his door with a diary which belonged to their teacher, Clément Mathieu. They proceed to read it together.\\nIn 1950, fifty-four years earlier, Clément Mathieu (Gérard Jugnot), a failed musician, arrives at Fond de l\\'Étang (\"Bottom of the Pond\"), a French boarding school for troubled boys of all ages, to work as a supervisor and teacher. At the gate, he sees a very young boy, Pépinot (Maxence Perrin), waiting for Saturday, when he says his father will pick him up. The viewers later learn that his parents were killed in the Second World War during the Nazi occupation of France, but Pépinot does not know this.\\nMathieu discovers the boys being ruthlessly punished by the very strict headmaster, Rachin (François Berléand) and attempts to use humour and kindness to win them over. When a booby trap set by one of the boys, Le\\xa0Querrec, injures the school\\'s elderly caretaker, Maxence (Jean-Paul Bonnaire), Mathieu keeps the culprit\\'s identity from the headmaster, while encouraging Le\\xa0Querrec to nurse Maxence during his recovery.\\nOn discovering the boys singing rude songs about him, Mathieu forms a plan: he will teach them to sing and form a choir as a form of discipline. He groups the boys according to their voice types, but one student, Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier), refuses to sing. Mathieu catches Morhange singing to himself, discovers he has a wonderful singing voice and awards him solo parts on the condition that he behaves.\\nMorhange\\'s single mother, Violette (Marie Bunel), arrives at the school. When Mathieu goes to explain that Morhange cannot be visited because he has been locked up as a punishment, he finds himself pitying and being attracted to the boy\\'s beleaguered mother and instead tells her that Morhange is at the dentist. Meanwhile, a cruel, uncontrollable boy named Mondain (Grégory Gatignol\\xa0[fr]) arrives and begins causing trouble by bullying the others, influencing others to be like him and generally being rebellious. After stealing a watch, he is locked up for two weeks.\\nThe choir is improving rapidly with Morhange as its lead soloist; the children are happier, and the faculty less strict — even Rachin begins to loosen up, playing football with the boys and making a paper aeroplane. After Mondain is released from lock-up, he runs away and seemingly steals all the school\\'s money. After Mondain is captured, Rachin repeatedly beats him, until Mondain in turn attempts to strangle Rachin. Rachin hands him over to the police, still not knowing the location of the stolen money, and disbands the choir. Mathieu begins teaching his choir \"underground\", practising at night in their dormitory.\\nMathieu continues to meet Morhange\\'s mother, who is unaware of his attraction to her. He plans to help her son win a scholarship to the music conservatory in Lyon. One day she blithely informs him that she has met someone: an engineer. Mathieu is dejected but expresses his feigned happiness and watches her leave in the engineer\\'s car.\\nThe Countess, a sponsor of the school, finds out about the choir; they perform before her and others, and Morhange enchants the audience with his solo. Mathieu discovers that another boy, Corbin, stole the money that Mondain was accused of taking. Despite this, Rachin refuses to accept Mondain back at the school.\\nWhen Rachin departs to accept an award from the board after taking credit for the choir, Mathieu and Maxence suspend classes and take the boys on an outing. While they are out, Mondain returns and sets fire to the school. Mathieu is fired for breaking the rules, even though he saved the boys\\' lives, and Maxence is suspended. As Mathieu leaves, the boys —forbidden to say goodbye — lock themselves in their classroom, sing and throw farewell messages out of the window on paper planes. Touched, Mathieu walks away, musing about how he has failed and nobody knows of his existence.\\nBack in the present, the adult Morhange finishes reading the diary and recounts what happened afterwards: he won his scholarship to the conservatory, and Rachin was fired after his fellow teachers exposed his abuse towards the students. Mathieu, Pépinot relates, continued to give music lessons quietly for the rest of his life.\\nThe final scene (in the past again) shows Mathieu waiting for his bus after being fired. As he boards it, he looks back and finds Pépinot running after him, insisting that he come too. Initially, Mathieu refuses because it is not allowed, and he leaves Pépinot behind. Suddenly, the bus stops and Mathieu gives in: the two board the bus together. Pépinot finally got his wish, for he and Mathieu left on a Saturday, and Mathieu raised him.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'Brave is a 2012 American computer-animated fantasy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The film was directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman (in the former\\'s feature directorial debut), co-directed by Steve Purcell, and produced by Katherine Sarafian, with John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and Pete Docter serving as executive producers. The story was written by Chapman, who also wrote the film\\'s screenplay with Andrews, Purcell, and Irene Mecchi. The film stars the voices of Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters, Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd, and Craig Ferguson. Set in the Scottish Highlands, the film tells the story of Princess Merida of DunBroch (Macdonald) who defies an age-old custom, causing chaos in the kingdom by expressing the desire not to be betrothed. When Queen Elinor (Thompson), her mother, falls victim to a beastly curse and turns into a bear, Merida must look within herself and find the key to saving the kingdom. Merida is the first character in the Disney Princess line created by Pixar. The film is also dedicated to Pixar chairman and Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs, who died before the film\\'s release.\\nBrave is Pixar\\'s first film with a female protagonist, and the first one animated with a new proprietary animation system, called Presto.[3] Originally titled The Bear and the Bow, the film was first announced in April 2008 alongside Up and Cars 2. Chapman drew inspiration for the film\\'s story from her relationship with her own daughter. Co-directing with Andrews and Purcell, Chapman became Pixar\\'s first female director of a feature-length film.[4] To create the most complex visuals possible, Pixar completely rewrote their animation system for the first time in 25 years.[5][6][7] Brave is the first film to use the Dolby Atmos sound format.[8] The filmmakers created three original tartan patterns for three of the four clans in the film. Patrick Doyle composed the film\\'s musical score.\\nBrave premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival on June 10, 2012, and was theatrically released in North America on June 22. Receiving generally positive reviews, it was a box office success, grossing $540.4 million against a $185 million budget. The film won the Academy Award,[9][10] the Golden Globe,[11] and the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Feature Film.[12] Preceding the feature theatrically was a short film entitled La Luna, directed by Enrico Casarosa.[13]\\n\\nPlot: In Medieval Scotland, young Princess Merida of the clan Dunbroch celebrates her birthday and is given a bow and arrow by her father, King Fergus, much to the dismay of his wife Queen Elinor. While venturing into the woods to fetch an arrow, Merida encounters a will-o\\'-the-wisp. Soon afterward, Mor\\'du, a huge demon bear, attacks the family. Merida flees on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus and his men fend off Mor\\'du, though the fight costs the king one of his legs.\\nTen years later, the relationship between Merida and Elinor has strained, due to the latter’s strict determination to shape Merida into a respectable princess. Merida is shocked to discover that she is to be betrothed to the son of one of her father\\'s allies. Elinor explains that failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch, reminding Merida of a legend of a prince whose pride and refusal to follow his father\\'s wishes destroyed his kingdom.\\nThe allied clan chieftains and their first-born sons arrive to compete in the Highland games for Merida\\'s hand in marriage. Merida twists the rules, announcing that, as her own clan\\'s firstborn, she will compete for her own hand. She easily bests her suitors in an archery contest, shaming them and infuriating Elinor, who burns Merida\\'s bow in the ensuing argument. In tears, Merida runs away into the forest. Wisps appear, leading her to the hut of an elderly witch. Merida bargains for a spell to \"change\" Elinor, and the witch gives her an enchanted cake.\\nWhen Merida gives Elinor the cake, it transforms Elinor into a bear, unable to speak but still retaining most of her human consciousness. Merida returns to the witch\\'s cottage with Elinor, only to find it deserted, and discovers a message from the witch: unless Merida is able to \"mend the bond, torn by pride\" before the second sunrise, the spell will become permanent. Merida and Elinor begin to bond over catching fish to eat, but Merida soon realises her mother’s humanity is slipping away and natural bear instincts are taking over. Running out of time, the pair are led by the wisps to ancient ruins, where they encounter and narrowly evade Mor\\'du. Realising that Mor\\'du was the prince in the legend, Merida vows that she will not let the same thing happen to her mother, and concludes she needs to repair the family tapestry she deliberately damaged during their argument.\\nThey return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Merida intends to relent and declare herself ready to choose a suitor as tradition demands, but Elinor prompts her instead to insist that the firstborns should be allowed to marry in their own time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing and strengthening their alliance.\\nMerida sneaks into the tapestry room with Elinor; however, Fergus walks in on them. Elinor, who is losing her humanity, attacks Fergus, but suddenly regains her composure and flees the castle. Mistaking the Queen for Mor\\'du, and thinking it has eaten his wife, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans, locking Merida in the castle for her protection. Merida escapes with the assistance of her identical triplet brothers, Harris, Hubert, and Hamish, who have also eaten the enchanted cake and are now bear cubs. Merida repairs the tapestry and rides out after her father. Fergus and the clans capture Elinor, but Merida thwarts them before the real Mor\\'du arrives. Mor\\'du battles with the clan warriors and targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, holding off Mor\\'du and causing him to be crushed by a falling menhir. This releases the spirit of the prince, who silently thanks Merida for freeing him and transforms into a wisp. Merida covers her mother in the repaired tapestry as the sun rises for the second time, but she remains a bear. Merida, believing it was all for nothing, tearfully embraces her mother, expressing regret for allowing their relationship to stray and become tense. Her expression of love unknowingly fulfils the true meaning of the witch\\'s message and reverses the spell\\'s effects on her mother and brothers.\\nWith Mor\\'du gone, Merida and Elinor’s new relationship is much more joyful and they work together on a new tapestry. After they are called to the docks to bid farewell to the other clans, they ride their horses together.\\n'},\n",

The film is a sequel to Arcand\\'s 1986 film The Decline of the American Empire, continuing the story of the character Rémy, a womanizing history professor now terminally ill with cancer.\\nThe sequel was a result of Arcand\\'s longtime desire to make a film about a character close to death, also incorporating a response to the September 11 attacks of 2001. It was produced by companies from both Canada and France, and shot mainly in Montreal, also employing a former hospital and property near Lake Memphremagog.\\nThe film received a positive response from critics and became one of Arcand\\'s biggest financial successes. It was the first Canadian film to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, at the 76th Academy Awards in 2004. It won awards at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, six Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture, and three César Awards, including Best Film.

Sébastien is not enthused about seeing Rémy, whom he blames for breaking up the family with his many adulteries. Rémy and his friends of the older generation are still largely social-democrats and proponents of Quebec nationalism, positions seeming somewhat anachronistic long after the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. Rémy does not like Sébastien\\'s career, lack of reading or fondness for video games.\\nThe father and son travel to the U.S. state of Vermont to briefly receive medical care before returning to the overcrowded and disorganized Quebec hospital. Sébastien attempts to bribe hospital administration for better care, and calls Rémy\\'s old friends about a possible visit. Upon hearing heroin is \"800%\" more effective than morphine, he tracks some down for Rémy from a drug addict, Nathalie.\\nMeanwhile, Rémy is reunited with his friends, including Pierre, Dominique, Claude and Diane, Nathalie\\'s mother, and they share a conversation on their old sex drive and the gradual decline of their vitality. Diane is concerned for Nathalie, while Rémy, a history professor, lectures the hospital chaplain Constance on the relative peace of the 20th century compared to past centuries. At the same time, another scholar describes the September 11 attacks as historically small except as a possible beginning of modern barbarian invasions.  After Rémy and his friends retreat to the countryside, they speak of their devotion to constantly evolving -isms. Rémy dies in the company of his friends and Sébastien, after a heroin injection from Nathalie, whom Rémy calls his guardian angel.\\n'},\n",

Upon release, the film was a critical and commercial failure, grossing $6.9 million under a budget of $17.9 million.\\n\\nPlot: Sonja, a young, red-haired woman, is gang raped and left for dead by hundreds of soldiers of Queen Gedren, a despot who murdered Sonja\\'s parents and brother after she rejected the queen\\'s sexual advances and scarred Gedren\\'s face. Answering Sonja\\'s cry for revenge, a nameless female spirit appears and gives her heightened sword-fighting skills on the condition that she never lie with a man unless he defeats her in fair combat. She trains under the warriors of a sword-master called \"The Grand Master\" and distrusts nearly all other men. \\nAt a nearby temple, Varna, Sonja\\'s sister, is in an order of priestesses preparing to banish a mystical light-powered relic, the Talisman, that created the world and all living things. The Talisman can be used and touched only by women – men vanish if they touch it – and has become too powerful to control. However, Gedren\\'s army and her aide-de-camp Ikol intervene, slaughtering most of the priestesses and shield-maidens before they can imprison the Talisman in permanent darkness.\\nVarna watches Gedren steal the Talisman and throw the surviving priestesses in the vault that contained it, before escaping, but is mortally wounded. She is discovered by Kalidor, the Lord of Hyrkania, who goes to find Sonja and bring her to Varna. Before dying, Varna tells Sonja to find the Talisman and send it into darkness before it ravages the world with storms and earthquakes. Kalidor asks to accompany her, but she rejects the offer. \\nAfter witnessing the Talisman in use, Sonja arrives to the now-ruined kingdom of Hablock. She meets the young, pig-headed Prince Tarn and his servant/bodyguard Falkon, who say Gedren used the Talisman to decimate Hablock when Tarn refused to surrender. Tarn announces that he will crush Gedren, and invites Sonja to be his cook. She politely declines before being told that Gedren is based in Berkubane, the land of Perpetual Night.\\nArriving at the mountain gate, Sonja fights Lord Brytag after he refuses her passage for not paying him a \"tender tribute\". When she kills him and takes his key, his troops surround her; Kalidor, who has secretly followed her, attacks their rear, allowing Sonja to escape. Sonja comes across Tarn again, being tortured by bandits. She frees Tarn and kills the bandits with Falkon. They decide to travel together toward Berkubane, and Tarn takes Sonja\\'s advice and learns good manners over sword practice. \\nGedren\\'s wizard uses a large magic screen to show the approaching party; Gedren recognizes Sonja and orders that she be brought to the fortress unharmed. Using the Talisman to conjure a storm, she forces Sonja\\'s group to take shelter in a watery cavern in Ictyan where Gedren\\'s dragon-like “Killing Machine\" is unleashed.

It is the fourth mainline installment in the X-Men film series and the fifth installment overall. It was directed by Matthew Vaughn and produced by Bryan Singer, and stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence, January Jones, Oliver Platt, and Kevin Bacon. At the time of its release, it was intended to be a franchise reboot[7] and contradicted the events of previous films; however, the follow-up film X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) retconned First Class into a prequel to X-Men (2000). First Class is set primarily in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and focuses on the relationship between Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, and the origin of their groups—the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants, respectively, as they deal with the Hellfire Club led by Sebastian Shaw, a mutant supremacist bent on enacting nuclear war.\\nProducer Lauren Shuler Donner first thought of a prequel based on the young X-Men during the production of X2; producer Simon Kinberg later suggested to 20th Century Fox an adaptation of the comic series X-Men: First Class, although the film does not follow the comic closely. Singer, who had directed both X-Men and X2, became involved with the project in 2009, but he could only produce and co-write First Class due to his work on other projects. Vaughn, who was previously attached to both X-Men: The Last Stand and Thor, became the director, and also wrote the final script with his writing partner Jane Goldman. First Class replaced a Magneto prequel film that had been in development, but had entered development hell; the Writers Guild of America arbitration gave a story credit to Magneto writer Sheldon Turner. Principal photography began in August 2010 and concluded in December, with additional filming completed in April 2011. Locations included Oxford, the Mojave Desert and Georgia, with soundstage work done in both Pinewood Studios and the 20th Century Fox stages in Los Angeles. The depiction of the 1960s drew inspiration from the James Bond films of the period.\\nFirst Class premiered in Ziegfeld Theatre on May 25, 2011, and was released in the United States on June 3, 2011. It was a box office success, becoming the seventh highest-grossing in the film series, and received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its acting (particularly McAvoy and Fassbender), screenplay, direction, action sequences, visual effects, and musical score. The film\\'s success re-popularized the X-Men film franchise with various installments following, including a number of sequels focusing on younger iterations of the X-Men characters, with X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), X-Men: Apocalypse (2016), and X-Men: Dark Phoenix (2019).\\n\\nPlot: In 1944, at the Auschwitz concentration camp, Nazi officer Klaus Schmidt witnesses young prisoner Erik Lehnsherr bend a metal gate with his mind upon being separated from his mother. In his office, Schmidt orders Erik to move a coin on his desk, and kills his mother when Erik can\\'t. In grief and anger, Erik\\'s magnetic power manifests, killing two guards and destroying the room. Separately, at a mansion in Westchester County, New York, child telepath Charles Xavier meets young shapeshifter Raven, whose natural form is blue-skinned and scaly. Overjoyed to meet someone \"different\", like himself, he invites her to live with his family as his foster sister.\\nIn 1962, Erik is tracking down Schmidt to avenge his mother, while Xavier earns his doctorate from the University of Oxford as Professor of Genetics. In Las Vegas, CIA officer Moira MacTaggert follows U.S. Army Colonel Hendry into the Hellfire Club, where she sees Schmidt (now called Sebastian Shaw) with mutant telepath Emma Frost, cyclone-producing Riptide, and teleporter Azazel. Threatened by Shaw and teleported to the Joint War Room, Hendry advocates deploying nuclear missiles in Turkey. Shaw, an energy-absorbing mutant whose powers have kept him young, later kills Hendry.\\nMoira, seeking Xavier\\'s advice on mutation, takes him and Raven to the CIA, where they convince Director McCone that mutants exist and Shaw is a threat. Another CIA officer sponsors the mutants and invites them to the secret \"Division X\" facility. Moira and Xavier find Shaw as Erik is attacking him, and rescue Erik from drowning. Shaw escapes. Xavier brings Erik to Division X, where they meet young scientist Hank McCoy, a mutant with prehensile feet, who believes Raven\\'s DNA may provide a \"cure\" for their appearance. Xavier uses McCoy\\'s mutant-locating device Cerebro to seek recruits against Shaw. Xavier and Erik recruit stripper Angel Salvadore, cabbie Armando Muñoz, Army prisoner Alex Summers, and drifter Sean Cassidy. They create nicknames, Raven dubbing herself \"Mystique\".\\nWhen Frost meets with a Soviet general in the USSR, and uses her telepathic powers to manipulate him, Xavier and Erik capture her and discover Shaw intends to start World War III, triggering mutant ascendency. Azazel, Riptide and Shaw attack Division X, killing everyone but the mutants, whom Shaw invites to join him. Salvadore accepts; when Alex and Muñoz retaliate, Shaw kills Muñoz. In Moscow, Shaw compels the general to have the USSR install missiles in Cuba. Wearing a helmet that blocks telepathy, Shaw follows the Soviet fleet in a submarine to ensure the missiles break a U.S. blockade. In the meantime, Xavier takes the remaining recruits back to his mansion where they focus on harnessing their abilities. McCoy manages to get a cure ready, but Raven, after being persuaded by Erik, decides she doesn\\'t want to hide her identity and refuses the cure. McCoy uses the cure on himself but it backfires, giving him blue fur and leonine aspects.\\nWith McCoy piloting, the mutants and Moira take a jet to the blockade line, where Xavier uses his telepathy to influence a Soviet sailor to destroy the ship carrying the missiles, and Erik uses his magnetic power to lift Shaw\\'s submarine from the water and deposit it on land. During the ensuing battle, Erik seizes Shaw\\'s helmet, allowing Xavier to immobilize Shaw. While Shaw is helpless, Erik reveals he shares Shaw\\'s exclusivist view of mutants but, to avenge his mother, uses his power to kill Shaw by slowly pushing a Nazi coin through Shaw\\'s brain, killing him. Unable to risk releasing Shaw, Xavier begs Erik to stop, but is forced to experience the pain of Shaw\\'s death.\\nBoth fleets fire missiles at the mutants, which Erik turns back in mid-flight. Moira tries to stop Erik by shooting him but he deflects the bullets, one of which hits Xavier in the spine. Erik rushes to help Xavier and, distracted, allows the missiles to fall harmlessly into the ocean. Parting with Xavier over their differing views on the relationship between mutants and humans, Erik leaves with Salvadore, Azazel, Riptide and Mystique. Later, a wheelchair-using Xavier and his mutants are at the mansion, where he intends to open a school. Moira promises Xavier never to reveal his location, but Xavier makes sure of this by wiping her memories. Meanwhile, Erik, along with Mystique and the other Hellfire Club members, frees Frost from confinement and dubs himself \"Magneto\".\\n'},\n",

It was followed by Star Trek Beyond in 2016.\\n\\nPlot: In 2259, Captain James T. Kirk is removed from command of the starship USS Enterprise for violating the Prime Directive by revealing the ship to the primitive inhabitants of the planet Nibiru in order to save them, and Spock, from a cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Admiral Christopher Pike is reinstated as commanding officer with Kirk demoted to first officer. Spock is transferred to another ship. Shortly after, Starfleet officer Thomas Harewood, sent by Commander John Harrison, bombs a Section 31 installation in London. During an emergency meeting on the situation, Harrison uses a ship to ambush and kill Pike and other senior officers, before transporting to Kronos, homeworld of the hostile Klingons.\\nAdmiral Alexander Marcus reinstates Kirk and Spock to Enterprise with orders to kill Harrison using a new long range stealth torpedo. Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott objects to allowing untested torpedoes on board without knowing their specifications; when he is overruled, he resigns. Kirk assigns Pavel Chekov to replace Scotty. En route to Kronos, Enterprise's warp capabilities become disabled. Kirk leads a team with Spock and Uhura to the planet, where they are ambushed by Klingon patrols. Harrison appears and kills the Klingons. Harrison surrenders when he learns the precise number of torpedoes on board Enterprise.\\nDr. Leonard McCoy and Marcus's daughter, Dr. Carol Marcus, open a torpedo at Harrison's urging, revealing the torpedoes contain cryonically-frozen humans. Harrison is taken to Enterprise's brig, where he reveals his true identity as Khan Noonien Singh, a genetically engineered superhuman, awoken by Admiral Marcus from centuries of sleep and forced to develop advanced weapons. Khan reveals that Marcus sabotaged Enterprise's warp drive, intending for the Klingons to destroy the ship after it fired on Kronos, sparking war with the Klingon Empire. Khan also gives Kirk a set of coordinates, which Kirk asks Scott to investigate. Scott discovers the coordinates lead to a covert Starfleet facility.\\nEnterprise is intercepted by a much larger Starfleet warship, USS Vengeance, commanded by Admiral Marcus. Marcus demands that Kirk deliver Khan, but Enterprise flees to Earth to expose him. After Vengeance disables Enterprise near the Moon, Carol reveals her presence aboard Enterprise to stop the attack. Marcus forcibly transports Carol to Vengeance before ordering Enterprise's destruction. Vengeance loses power after being sabotaged by Scott, who infiltrated the ship. With transporters down, Kirk and Khan, with the latter's knowledge of the warship's design, space-jump to Vengeance. Meanwhile, Spock contacts his future self on New Vulcan, who tells him of his own encounter with Khan and warns that he cannot be trusted. After fighting their way to the bridge, Khan overpowers Kirk, Scott, and Carol, kills Marcus, and takes control of Vengeance.\\nKhan demands that Spock return his frozen crew in exchange for the Enterprise officers. Spock complies, having had McCoy surreptitiously remove Khan's frozen crew from the torpedoes beforehand. When Khan starts shooting at Enterprise, Spock detonates the warheads, crippling the ship. With both starships caught in Earth's gravity, they plummet toward the surface. Kirk enters Enterprise's radioactive reactor chamber to realign the warp core, sacrificing himself to save the ship.\\nKhan crashes Vengeance into downtown San Francisco in an attempt to destroy Starfleet headquarters, while McCoy discovers that Khan's blood has regenerative properties that may save Kirk. A vengeful Spock pursues Khan through the city and the two engage in hand-to-hand combat. Uhura beams down and stuns Khan. Spock prepares to kill Khan, but Uhura stops him, explaining he is their only chance to save Kirk. Khan's blood revives Kirk and Khan is sealed in his cryogenic pod and stored with his compatriots. One year later, Kirk speaks at Enterprise's re-dedication ceremony. The Enterprise crew embarks on a five-year exploratory mission.\\n\"},\n",

Donna\\'s mother, Ruby, is a famous singer, but she has a strained relationship with her daughter and is consistently away on tour, and does not attend the graduation. Fed up with her mother\\'s constant negligence and determined to spend her life making memories, Donna decided to travel to Kalokairi to find her destiny.\\nIn the present,[a] Sophie is in Kalokairi preparing for the grand reopening of the Hotel Bella Donna, in honour of her recently deceased mother. Harry and Bill are unable to attend due to overseas business ventures and Sophie also feels estranged from Sky, who\\'s been offered a permanent job in New York (\"One of Us\").\\nIn Paris, Donna meets the sweet but awkward Harry Bright, who instantly falls in love with her (\"Waterloo\"). They spend the night together, but Donna leaves soon after for Greece. She misses her boat to Kalokairi but is offered a ride by Bill Anderson in his yacht, and the two dance and flirt (\"Why Did It Have to Be Me?\"). On the way, they help a stranded fisherman, Alexio, back to shore in time to save the love of his life from having to marry another. Unbeknownst to Donna, Harry has followed her to Greece; however, he arrives too late and sadly watches the boat sailing off in the distance.\\nIn the present, Rosie and Tanya arrive to support Sophie, and she shows them the new hotel (\"I Have a Dream\"). This mirrors the past, in which Donna explores an abandoned farmhouse that would eventually become the hotel. A heavy storm then breaks out and Donna discovers a trapped horse and soothes it with the assistance of Sam Carmichael. In the present, a heavy storm destroys the decorations and prevents transportation to Kalokairi, much to Sophie\\'s dismay.\\nSam, who has been living in a cabin on the island, reassures Sophie that she can never let her mother down, telling her the story of how he once let Donna down. Years ago, before Sophie was born, Donna and Sam were enjoying a whirlwind romance (\"The Name of the Game\"), but it ended badly when Donna found out Sam was engaged to another woman, Lorraine. Heartbroken, Donna breaks up with him and tearfully watches him leave the island (\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\"), while the present Sam reassures Sophie of her mother\\'s value for her.\\nFollowing Sam\\'s departure, Donna is visited by Tanya and Rosie, who cheer her up by singing with her as Donna and the Dynamos (\"Mamma Mia\"). Bill returns to the island, and Donna joins him on his boat, much to the chagrin of Rosie who falls for Bill. While they are gone, Sam returns, having ended his engagement for Donna, but is saddened to hear that she is with another man. Donna discovers she is pregnant but has no idea which one of her three recent lovers is the father. Bill\\'s great-aunt Sofia overhears Donna\\'s wish to stay on the island and reveals she owns the abandoned farmhouse Donna has been staying in. Donna happily accepts her offer to stay there, where she eventually gives birth to Sophie.\\nIn the present, Sophie opens up to Rosie and Tanya about her conflict with Sky and Rosie explains to Sophie how she and Bill broke up (\"Angel Eyes\"). Meanwhile, Bill, Harry, and Sky leave their ventures abroad to support Sophie but are told there are no boats to Kalokairi. However, a much older Alexio recognises Bill and offers the trio safe boat passage to the island as gratitude for saving his relationship. Bill convinces the others to join them for a party on Kalokairi. When the guests arrive (\"Dancing Queen\"), Bill and Rosie quickly reunite over their mutual grief over Donna\\'s death, and Sophie reveals to Sky that she is pregnant, and she has never felt closer to her mother.\\nThe celebration is suddenly disrupted when Ruby arrives, despite Sophie having decided to not invite her. Ruby explains that Sky tracked her down in New York, and she wants to build a true relationship with her granddaughter. Sophie then performs with the Dynamos in honor of Donna (\"I\\'ve Been Waiting for You\"), much to the pride of Ruby, who expresses slight but sincere grief over her daughter\\'s death. It is then revealed that the hotel manager, Señor Fernando Cienfuegos, is actually Ruby\\'s long-lost lover from 1959, and the two are joyously reunited (\"Fernando\").\\nNine months later, Sophie has given birth to a baby boy, named Donny. At the christening, Donna\\'s ghost proudly watches over her daughter as the two of them have one final moment before Donna fully passes on (\"My Love, My Life\").

In 2003, she is stationed at the U.S. embassy in Pakistan. She and CIA officer Dan Fuller attend the black site interrogations of Ammar (Reda Kateb), a detainee with suspected links to several of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks and who is subjected to approved enhanced interrogation techniques. Ammar provides unreliable information on a suspected attack in Saudi Arabia, but reveals the name of the personal courier for bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Other detainee intelligence connects courier traffic by Abu Ahmed between Abu Faraj al-Libbi and bin Laden. In 2005, Faraj denies knowing about a courier named Abu Ahmed; Maya interprets this as an attempt by Faraj to conceal the importance of Abu Ahmed.\\nIn 2009, Maya\\'s fellow officer and friend Jessica travels to a US base in Afghanistan to meet a Jordanian doctor, highly placed in al-Qaeda, who has offered to become a US spy for $25 million.

Maya and her CIA team in Pakistan use electronic methods to eventually pinpoint a caller in a moving vehicle who exhibits behaviors that delay confirmation of his identity (which Maya calls tradecraft, thus confirming that the subject is likely a senior courier). They track the vehicle to a large urban compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. After gunmen attack Maya while she is in her vehicle, she is recalled to Washington, D.C. as her cover is believed blown.\\nThe CIA puts the compound under surveillance but obtains no conclusive identification of bin Laden.

It stars Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson, Selma Blair, Matthew Davis, Victor Garber, and Jennifer Coolidge. The story follows Elle Woods (Witherspoon), a sorority girl who attempts to win back her ex-boyfriend Warner Huntington III (Davis) by getting a Juris Doctor degree at Harvard Law School, and in the process, overcomes stereotypes against blondes and triumphs as a successful lawyer.\\nThe outline of Legally Blonde originated from Brown\\'s experiences as a blonde going to Harvard Law School while being obsessed with fashion and beauty, reading Elle  magazine, and frequently clashing with the personalities of her peers. In 2000, Brown met producer Marc Platt, who helped her develop her manuscript into a novel. Platt brought in screenwriters McCullah Lutz and Smith to adapt the book into a motion picture. The project caught the attention of director Luketic, an Australian newcomer who came to Hollywood on the success of his quirky debut short film Titsiana Booberini. \"I had been reading scripts for two years, not finding anything I could put my own personal mark on, until Legally Blonde came around,\" Luketic said.\\nThe film was released on July 13, 2001, and was a hit with audiences, grossing $141 million worldwide on an $18 million budget, as well as receiving moderately positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going to Witherspoon\\'s performance. It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture: Musical or Comedy. Witherspoon received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and the 2002 MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance. The film has gained a cult following.\\nThe box office success led to a series of films: a 2003 sequel, Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde, and a 2009 direct-to-DVD spin-off, Legally Blondes. Additionally, Legally Blonde: The Musical premiered on January 23, 2007, in San Francisco and opened in New York City at the Palace Theatre on Broadway on April 29, 2007, starring Laura Bell Bundy.\\nIn May 2020, it was announced that Mindy Kaling and Dan Goor were signed to write a third film.[4] The third film was set to release in 2022 but has been delayed to an undisclosed date.\\n\\nPlot: Fashion merchandising student and sorority girl Elle Woods is taken to an expensive restaurant by her boyfriend, Warner Huntington III. She expects a proposal, but he breaks up with her instead. Intending to go to Harvard Law School and become a successful senator, he believes that Elle is not \"serious\" enough for that kind of life. Elle believes she can win Warner back if she shows herself capable of achieving the same things. After months of studying, Elle scores a 179 on the Law School Admission Test[5] and, combined with her 4.0 GPA, is accepted to Harvard Law School.\\nUpon arriving at Harvard, Elle finds her SoCal personality is a complete contrast to her East Coast classmates, who ridicule her. She soon encounters Warner but discovers he is engaged to his old girlfriend, Vivian Kensington, who considers Elle a fool. Later, Elle tells Warner that she intends to apply for one of her professor\\'s internships, but he tells her that she is wasting her time as she is not intelligent enough. Realizing that Warner will never take her back or take her seriously, Elle finds motivation to prove herself by working hard and demonstrating her understanding of the subject.\\nThe following semester, Professor Callahan, the school\\'s most respected teacher, decides to take on some first-year interns to help with a high-profile case. Among those chosen are Elle, Warner, and Vivian. Callahan is defending a prominent fitness instructor named Brooke Windham, one of Elle\\'s role models. Accused of murdering her husband, Brooke is unwilling to produce her alibi, and she later reveals to Elle that she was having liposuction, a fact that would ruin her reputation, which Elle promises not to disclose. Vivian gains a new respect for Elle and reveals that Warner could not get into Harvard without his father\\'s help. Emmett Richmond, Callahan\\'s junior partner, has also taken notice of her potential.\\nOne night, Callahan tries seducing Elle, who now believes that is why she got the internship. Vivian only sees part of their interaction and mistakenly accuses Elle of having an affair with Callahan. Devastated, she quits and nearly returns home to California, telling Emmett what happened. When he tells Brooke, she fires Callahan, replacing him with Elle under Emmett\\'s guidance; as she is only a law student, Emmett cites a Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling that law students may represent clients if they do so under the supervision of a licensed attorney.\\nElle begins to cross-examine Brooke\\'s stepdaughter, Chutney, and catches her in a lie when she discovers a major inconsistency in her story: Chutney testified that she was home during her father\\'s murder but did not hear the gunshot because she was in the shower after getting her hair permed that morning. Elle says that washing permed hair within the first 24 hours would deactivate the ammonium thioglycolate, pointing out that Chutney\\'s curls are still intact. A distraught Chutney admits her culpability in inadvertently killing her father as she really intended to kill Brooke because she hated the fact that her father married someone the same age as her.\\nAfter the trial, Chutney is sent to jail, and Warner asks Elle to take him back as she has proven herself.

       "  'Description': 'Terminator Genisys is a 2015 American science fiction action film[4] directed by Alan Taylor and written by Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier. Produced by Skydance Productions and distributed by Paramount Pictures, the film is a reboot of the Terminator franchise, taking the premise of the original film in another direction and ignoring the events depicted in sequels and the TV series.[5] It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, who reprises his role as the Terminator, alongside Jason Clarke, Emilia Clarke, Jai Courtney, J. K. Simmons, Dayo Okeniyi, Matt Smith, Courtney B. Vance, Michael Gladis, Sandrine Holt, and Lee Byung-hun. The story follows Kyle Reese, a soldier in a post-apocalyptic war against Skynet, who is sent from 2029 to 1984 to prevent Sarah Connor\\'s death. When Kyle arrives in the past, he discovers that the timeline has been altered by Skynet and that Sarah has been raised by a reprogrammed Terminator sent to protect her.\\nSequels for Terminator Salvation were cancelled after The Halcyon Company faced legal issues and filed for bankruptcy. Megan Ellison and her production company, Annapurna Pictures, acquired the franchise rights in May 2011. Skydance Productions, owned by Ellison\\'s brother David, collaborated the following year on a production of another installment in the series. The Ellisons consulted Terminator creator James Cameron and drew inspiration from The Terminator (1984) and its sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). Principal photography took place primarily in New Orleans, but also in San Francisco. Six companies handled the film\\'s visual effects, with its prosthetic make-up and animatronics created by Legacy Effects.\\nThe film premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on June 28, 2015, and was released in the United States on July 1, 2015. It received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the plot and acting, although Arnold Schwarzenegger\\'s return was praised. Terminator Genisys grossed over $440 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film of both the series and Schwarzenegger\\'s career, behind Terminator 2: Judgment Day.[6] However, its commercial performance was lower than anticipated, resulting in the cancellation of two planned sequels and a spin-off television series. A video game titled Terminator Genisys: Future War was released on May 18, 2017, and the film franchise moved forward with Terminator: Dark Fate, released in 2019 as a direct sequel to Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\\n\\nPlot: In 2029, Human Resistance leader John Connor launches a final offensive against Skynet, an artificial general intelligence system seeking to eliminate the human race. Before the Resistance can triumph, Skynet activates a time machine and sends a T-800/Model 101 Terminator back to 1984, to kill John\\'s mother Sarah. John\\'s right-hand man, Kyle Reese, volunteers to travel back in time to protect her. As Kyle floats in the machine\\'s magnetic field, he sees John being attacked by another Resistance soldier. This creates a temporal paradox that alters the timeline and causes Kyle to experience childhood memories from a parallel version of himself.\\nWhen it arrives in Los Angeles 1984, Skynet\\'s T-800 is disabled by Sarah and \"Pops\", a reprogrammed T-800. An unknown party had sent Pops to 1973 to protect Sarah when she was nine years old after her parents were killed by a T-1000 sent by Skynet. When Kyle arrives in 1984, he is intercepted by the T-1000, which Sarah and Pops destroy with acid. Sarah and Pops have constructed a makeshift time machine like Skynet\\'s and Sarah plans to stop Skynet by traveling to 1997, the year it becomes self-aware. However, realizing that the timeline has been altered, Kyle is convinced that the future has also changed. He recalls a warning he received in his childhood vision, convincing Sarah that they instead must travel to 2017 to stop Skynet. After fighting the T-1000, Pops has sustained exterior damages that prevent him from time traveling. He stays in 1984 and plans to meet up with Kyle and Sarah in the future, preparing for their arrival in the meantime.\\nIn 2017, Kyle and Sarah materialize in the middle of a busy San Francisco highway and are apprehended by city police. While they are treated for injuries, Sarah and Kyle learn that Skynet is called \"Genisys\"—a soon-to-be-unveiled global operating system which is embraced by the public. John suddenly appears and rescues Sarah and Kyle. Pops arrives and unexpectedly shoots John, revealing that John is now an advanced Terminator.[a] The resistance soldier who attacked John is revealed to have been Skynet in physical disguise as a Terminator.[b] While Kyle was traveling back in time, Skynet attacked John and infected him with a nanotechnology that converted him into a machine on a cellular level. John, tasked with ensuring Skynet\\'s creation, traveled back in time to assist Cyberdyne Systems with the development of Genisys, hence securing Skynet and its machines\\' rise. Pops fights John before trapping him long enough for them to escape.\\nA day before Skynet\\'s worldwide attack, Sarah, Kyle, and Pops retreat to a safe house and make final preparations to destroy Cyberdyne\\'s Genisys mainframe. They head toward Cyberdyne\\'s headquarters with John in close pursuit. During an airborne chase, Pops dive-bombs into John\\'s helicopter and causes it to crash. John survives the crash and enters the Cyberdyne complex, where it advances the countdown from 13 hours to 15 minutes. Kyle, Sarah, and Pops plant bombs at key points in the facility while holding off John.\\nIn a final battle, Pops traps John in the magnetic field of a prototype time machine. Both are destroyed, but just before the explosion the remains of Pops are flung out of the apparatus into a nearby experimental vat of mimetic polyalloy. Kyle and Sarah reach a bunker beneath the facility and the explosion sets off the bombs, preventing Genisys from coming online. Pops appears, upgraded with mimetic polyalloy components like that of the T-1000, and helps them escape from the debris.\\nThe trio travels to Kyle\\'s childhood home, where Kyle tells his younger self about Genisys and instructs him to repeat the warning to himself, securing the trio\\'s arrival from 1984. Sarah, Kyle, and Pops drive off into the countryside. A mid-credits scene reveals that the system core of Genisys, located in a protected subterranean chamber, has survived the explosion.[c]\\n'},\n",

It is the third (chronologically, the first) installment in the Underworld franchise and a prequel to the 2003 film Underworld. The film focuses primarily on the origins of the characters and the events that lead up to the Vampire–Lycan war. Kate Beckinsale, who starred in the previous Underworld films, appears briefly at the end of the film.\\n\\nPlot: Two decades have passed since a war began between a legion of vampires and the first clan of werewolves, a breed unable to take human form. Lucian is the first werewolf born capable of taking human form and the first to be called a Lycan. Viktor, a vampire elder, raises the child, envisioning a race of Lycan slaves guarding the coven\\'s fortress during the day and working as laborers for the vampires at night. The countryside is filled with savage werewolves born from William\\'s rampage, and human nobles beg Viktor for protection against the beasts: he grants it in exchange for tributes of silver, which enables him to keep his slaves under control. As Lucian grows up, he and Viktor\\'s daughter Sonja fall in love, and in their adult years they begin a secretive intimate relationship. Sonja is reckless and insubordinate, and one night Lucian escapes the shackles preventing him from turning werewolf and rescues Sonja from his werewolf brethren. Despite acknowledging that Lucian rescued his daughter, Viktor cannot forgive the escape and has Lucian whipped and imprisoned.\\nBy trading her seat on the vampire council, Sonja enlists the help of Andreas Tanis in orchestrating Lucian\\'s release. Lucian, unable to flee alone, liberates the other Lycans as he escapes. Sonja remains, planning to meet Lucian in three days. As she prepares to leave she is visited by her father. Viktor asks if she assisted in Lucian\\'s escape: she denies it, but he discovers the truth by biting her neck and reading her memories through her blood. Discovering her relationship with Lucian, he imprisons her. Lucian recruits both human slaves and werewolves to build a force against the vampires. In the fortress, the vampire council and nobles demand that Viktor recapture Lucian, as his Lycans have been attacking human estates, freeing their slaves and offering them immortality as Lycans themselves. Viktor replies that he is confident Lucian will return as he has something Lucian wants: Sonja.\\nLucian learns about Sonja\\'s imprisonment and rescues her from her room, but they are stopped from escaping by Viktor. Sonja, hoping to spare Lucian\\'s life, reveals to Viktor that she is pregnant with Lucian\\'s child. Disgusted, Viktor overpowers her and imprisons both her and Lucian. Sonja is unanimously sentenced to death by the council at a trial presided over by her father, and is executed by exposure to sunlight in Lucian\\'s presence.\\nAn enraged and heartbroken Lucian turns werewolf, but his attempt to escape the fortress is thwarted by the Death Dealers. He is able to communicate with and control the wild werewolves, however, and summons them to storm the fortress. A melee ensues in which vampire council members, their aides and lesser vampire nobles are killed. Realizing that Viktor intends to flee, Lucian pursues him and they fight. Lucian traps Viktor by exposing him to shafts of sunlight and then stabs him through the mouth with a sword and pushes his body down into a nearby body of water. With the battle over, Lucian\\'s deputy Raze declares that \"it is finished\", but Lucian knows this victory is only the beginning of what will become a war between the races. On a vampire ship fleeing the fortress, Viktor is revealed to have survived his wound and is sealed in an elder hibernation chamber by Tanis.\\nThe opening scene of the first Underworld film is then shown with the voice of vampire Kraven revealing to Selene that it was Viktor who killed her family, not the Lycans. Kraven adds that Viktor spared Selene\\'s life because she reminded him of his executed daughter Sonja. Selene, unaware of the truth, dismisses Kraven\\'s statement as \"lies\".\\n'},\n",

A program to study and potentially harness their powers soon escalates into an all-out genocide and shortly after the Purge begins, Selene and Michael are captured by humans. Due to her enhanced vampiric traits, Selene is imprisoned in cryogenic suspension.\\nAfter being frozen for twelve years, during which both species have been hunted to the brink of extinction, Selene manages to escape. She learns that another subject has also fled from the facility. While running away, Selene has visions from someone else\\'s point of view. She follows the visions and encounters David, a young vampire who has been tracking her. Sick and weakened Lycans also appear; they are hunting the subject with whom Selene is connected. Selene fights her way through the Lycan pack and reaches the second escapee: a frightened and confused young girl.\\nSelene, David and the girl drive away using David\\'s van, only to be attacked once again by a trio of Lycans. David and Selene kill two while the third smashes its way into the rear of the vehicle and bites the girl\\'s shoulder. She partially transforms and rips the creature in half, revealing her hybrid traits. Selene realizes this is her and Michael\\'s daughter. During her own escape from the facility, the girl found Selene\\'s cryogenic tank and deactivated it. That is why Selene could escape. Despite her hybrid nature, the girl\\'s bite wound does not heal and she is rapidly growing weaker, so David decides to take the pair to his coven.\\nAfter she reluctantly drinks some blood, her wound heals. But as they do not feel welcome in the coven, due to the fact that the girl is noticeably different from Vampires, Lycans and even Hybrid, Selene prepares to leave. David tries to convince her to stay and help them start an offensive against the humans. Before she makes up her mind, the coven comes under attack by Lycans. Selene joins the fight and kills many Lycans before being knocked unconscious by a huge \"Super-Lycan\" that heals instantly and is not affected by silver.

David has been mortally wounded in the battle, but Selene revives him with her blood. After leaving, she confronts Sebastian, a human detective who is sympathetic to the vampires due to his dead wife being a vampire. Sebastian confirms that the Lycans have been traced to Antigen, the corporation dedicated to killing off vampires. They also run the facility from which Selene has escaped.\\nAntigen is actually run by Lycans, who have been posing as humans in order to trick the world\\'s governments into believing the Lycans are extinct. The director of Antigen, Dr. Jacob Lane, is trying to perfect the Lycan race and needs the DNA of Selene\\'s daughter to do so. The \"Super-Lycan\" Selene faced earlier is Quint, Lane\\'s son and the prototype for Lycan modifications. Selene and Sebastian assault Antigen to stop Lane and save Selene\\'s daughter, who they begin calling \"Eve\". Selene comes across Subject 0, whom she identifies as Michael, and attempts to free him by shooting his cryogenic tank. However, she is forced to leave the thawing Michael in order to stop the Lycans from escaping with Eve. David, who since being healed by Selene\\'s blood has inherited her immunity to sunlight, arrives and helps the heroes. In the ensuing fight, Selene confronts Quint. She tricks him into returning to his more vulnerable human form by hiding in a narrow tunnel and kills him by implanting a silver grenade in his stomach. Meanwhile, Eve kills Lane by ripping out his throat. As the police arrive, Selene, Eve, and David return to Michael\\'s tank and find it empty. Knowing that the world will be hunting Michael, the trio vows to find him first.\\n'},\n",

Hank, who fears being released back into the ocean, agrees to help Dory find her parents in exchange for her tag. In one exhibit, Dory encounters her childhood friend Destiny, a nearsighted whale shark, who used to communicate with Dory through pipes, and Bailey, a beluga whale, who mistakenly believes he has lost his ability to echolocate. Dory subsequently has flashbacks of life with her parents and struggles to recall details. She finally remembers how she was separated from her parents: she overheard her mother crying one night, left to retrieve a shell to cheer her up, and was pulled away by an undertow current out into the ocean.\\nMarlin and Nemo attempt to rescue Dory. With the help of two lazy California sea lions named Fluke and Rudder and a common loon named Becky, they manage to get into the institute and find her in the pipe system. Other blue tangs tell them that Dory\\'s parents escaped from the institute a long time ago to search for her and never came back, leaving Dory to believe that they are dead. Hank retrieves Dory from the tank, accidentally leaving Marlin and Nemo behind. He is then apprehended by one of the employees and unintentionally drops Dory into the drain, flushing her out to the ocean. While wandering aimlessly, she comes across a trail of shells; remembering that when she was young, her parents had set out a similar trail to help her find her way back home, she follows it. At the end of the trail, Dory finds an empty brain coral with multiple shell trails leading to it. As she turns to leave, her parents arrive. They tell her they spent years laying down the trails for her to follow in the hopes that she would eventually find them.\\nMarlin, Nemo, and Hank end up in the truck taking various aquatic creatures to Cleveland. Destiny and Bailey escape from their exhibit to help Dory rescue them. Once onboard the truck, Dory persuades Hank to return to the sea with her, and together, they hijack the truck and drive it over busy highways, creating havoc, before crashing it into the sea, freeing all the fish. Dory, along with her parents and new friends, returns to the reef with Marlin and Nemo. Hank begins to adapt a happy lifestyle in the ocean and also becomes a teacher for Nemo\\'s school.\\nIn a post-credits scene, the Tank Gang (from Finding Nemo), still trapped inside their plastic bags, after one year floating across the Pacific Ocean, reach California; they are picked up by staff members from the Marine Life Institute, much to their dismay. Meantime, Fluke and Rudder’s enemy Gerald tries to sneak on to their rock.\\n'},\n",

She has improved his scams, posing as English aristocrat \"Lady Edith Greensly\". Irving loves Sydney, but is hesitant to leave his unstable and histrionic wife Rosalyn, fearing he will lose contact with his adopted son Danny. Rosalyn has also threatened to report Irving to the police if he leaves her. \\nFBI agent Richie DiMaso catches Irving and Sydney in a loan scam, but offers to release them if Irving can line up four additional arrests. Richie believes Sydney is English, but has proof that her claim of aristocracy is fraudulent. She tells Irving she will manipulate Richie, distancing herself from Irving.\\nIrving has a friend pretending to be a wealthy Arab sheikh looking for potential investments in America. An associate of Irving\\'s suggests the sheikh do business with Mayor Carmine Polito of Camden, New Jersey, who is trying to revitalize gambling in Atlantic City, but has struggled to find investors. Carmine seems to have a genuine desire to help the area\\'s economy and his constituents. \\nRichie devises a plan to make Mayor Polito the target of a sting operation, despite the objections of Irving and of Richie\\'s boss, Stoddard Thorsen. Sydney helps Richie manipulate an FBI secretary into making an unauthorized wire transfer of $2 million. When Stoddard\\'s boss, Anthony Amado, hears of the operation, he praises Richie\\'s initiative, pressuring Stoddard to continue.\\nCarmine leaves their meeting when Richie presses him to accept a cash bribe. Irving convinces him the sheikh is legitimate, expressing his dislike of Richie, and they become friends. Richie arranges for Carmine to meet the sheikh, and without consulting the others, has Mexican-American FBI agent Paco Hernandez play the sheikh, which displeases Irving. \\nCarmine brings the sheikh to a casino party, explaining that mobsters are there, and that it is a necessary part of doing business. Irving is surprised to hear that Mafia boss Victor Tellegio, right-hand man to Meyer Lansky, is present, and that he wants to meet the sheikh. Tellegio explains that the sheikh needs to become an American citizen, and that Carmine will need to expedite the process. Tellegio also requires a $10 million wire transfer to prove the sheikh\\'s legitimacy.\\nRichie confesses his strong attraction to Sydney, but becomes confused and aggressive when she drops her English accent and admits to being from Albuquerque. Rosalyn starts an affair with mobster Pete Musane, whom she met at the party. She mentions her belief that Irving is working with the IRS, causing Pete to threaten Irving, who promises to prove the sheikh\\'s investment is real. \\nIrving later confronts Rosalyn, who admits she told Pete and agrees to keep quiet, but wants a divorce. With Carmine\\'s help, Richie and Irving videotape members of Congress receiving bribes. Richie assaults Stoddard in a fight over the money, and later convinces Amado that he needs the $10 million to get Tellegio, but gets only $2 million. A meeting is arranged at the offices of Tellegio\\'s lawyer, Alfonse Simone, but Tellegio does not appear.\\nIrving visits Carmine and admits to the scam, but says he has a plan to help him. He throws him out, and the loss of their friendship deeply upsets Irving. The federal agents inform Irving that their $2 million is missing, and that they have received an anonymous offer to return the money in exchange for Irving and Sydney\\'s immunity and a reduced sentence for Carmine. \\nIt is revealed that Alfonse Simone, with whom Richie had arranged the wire transfer, was a con man working with Irving and Sydney. Amado accepts the deal, and Stoddard removes Richie from the case, which ends his career. The Congressmen are prosecuted, and so is Carmine, who is sentenced to 18 months in prison. Irving and Sydney move in together and open a legitimate art gallery, while Rosalyn lives with Pete and shares custody of Danny with Irving.\\n'},\n",

The film is the final instalment in Guadagnino\\'s thematic \"Desire\" trilogy, after I Am Love (2009), and A Bigger Splash (2015). Set in 1983 in northern Italy, Call Me by Your Name chronicles the romantic relationship between a 17-year-old, Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), and Oliver (Armie Hammer), a 24-year-old graduate-student assistant to Elio\\'s father Samuel (Michael Stuhlbarg), an archaeology professor. The film also stars actresses Amira Casar, Esther Garrel, and Victoire Du Bois.\\nDevelopment began in 2007 when producers Peter Spears and Howard Rosenman optioned the rights to Aciman\\'s novel. Ivory had been chosen to co-direct with Guadagnino, but stepped down in 2016. Guadagnino had joined the project as a location scout, and eventually became sole director and co-producer. Call Me by Your Name was financed by several international companies, and its principal photography took place mainly in the city and comune of Crema, Lombardy, between May and June 2016. Cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom used 35 mm film, as opposed to employing digital cinematography. The filmmakers spent weeks decorating Villa Albergoni, one of the main shooting locations. Guadagnino curated the film\\'s soundtrack, which features three original songs by American singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens.\\nSony Pictures Classics acquired distribution rights to Call Me by Your Name before its premiere at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2017. The film began a limited release in the United States on November 24, 2017, and went on general release on January 19, 2018. It received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Ivory\\'s screenplay, Guadagnino\\'s direction, Mukdeeprom\\'s cinematography, and the performances of Chalamet, Hammer, and Stuhlbarg. The film garnered a number of accolades, including many for its screenplay, direction, acting, and music. It received four nominations at the 90th Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for 22-year-old Chalamet (the third-youngest nominee in the category), and winning for Best Adapted Screenplay. The screenplay also won at the 23rd Critics\\' Choice Awards, 71st British Academy Film Awards, and the 70th Writers Guild of America Awards. Since then, it is now considered to be one of the best films of the 2010s and of the 21st century.[7][8][9]\\n\\nPlot: In the summer of 1983, Elio Perlman, a 17-year-old Jewish Italo-French boy, lives with his parents in rural Northern Italy. Elio\\'s father, a professor of archaeology, invites a 24-year-old Jewish American graduate student, Oliver, to live with the family over the summer and help with his academic paperwork. Elio, an introspective bibliophile and a musician, initially thinks he has little in common with Oliver, who appears confident and carefree. Elio spends much of the summer reading, playing piano, and hanging out with his childhood friends, Chiara and Marzia. During a volleyball match, Oliver touches Elio\\'s back but Elio brushes it off. However, Elio later finds himself jealous upon seeing Oliver pursue Chiara.\\nElio and Oliver spend more time together, going for long walks into town, and accompanying Elio\\'s father on an archaeological trip. Elio is increasingly drawn to Oliver, even sneaking to Oliver\\'s room to smell his clothing. Elio eventually confesses his feelings to Oliver, who tells him they cannot discuss such things. Later, in a secluded spot, the two kiss for the first time. Oliver is reluctant to take things further, and they do not speak for several days.\\nElio goes on a date with Marzia and the two have sex. Elio leaves a note for Oliver to end their silence. Oliver writes back, asking Elio to meet him at midnight. Elio agrees and they sleep together for the first time. Afterward, Oliver says to Elio, \"Call me by your name and I\\'ll call you by mine\". The morning after, Elio is briefly conflicted about their encounter and takes out his sexual frustration by masturbating with a peach. When Oliver finds him, Elio cries about how little time he and Oliver have left together. Marzia confronts Elio after not hearing from him for three days. He responds coldly, hurting her.\\nAs the end of Oliver\\'s stay approaches, Elio\\'s parents, who appear to be aware of the bond between the two, recommend that he and Oliver visit Bergamo together before Oliver returns to the U.S. They spend three romantic days together. Elio, heartbroken after Oliver\\'s departure, calls his mother and asks her to pick him up from the train station and take him home. Marzia is sympathetic to Elio\\'s feelings and says she wants to remain friends. Elio\\'s father, observing his unhappiness, tells him that the friendship he had with Oliver was rare and that he envied Elio because he never was able to have what Elio and Oliver had.\\nDuring Hanukkah, Oliver calls Elio\\'s family to tell them he is engaged to be married to a woman he has been seeing for a few years. An upset Elio calls Oliver by his name and Oliver responds with his; Oliver also says that he remembers everything. After the call, Elio sits down by the fireplace and stares into the flames, tearfully reflecting, as his parents and staff prepare the holiday dinner.\\n'},\n",

The film was an international co-production between Italy, West Germany, and Spain.[4][5] The film was released in the United States in 1967, and is the second part of what is commonly known as the Dollars Trilogy.\\n\\nPlot: The man that many call Manco is a bounty hunter, a profession shared by a former army officer, Colonel Douglas Mortimer. They separately learn that a ruthless, cold-blooded bank robber, \"El Indio\", has been broken out of prison by his gang, who slaughtered all but one of his jailers. While Indio is murdering the family of the man who had captured him, he is shown to carry a musical pocket watch taken from a woman who had shot herself while he was raping her after he had murdered her husband. The incident has haunted Indio, and he smokes an addictive drug to cloud his memory.\\nIndio plans to rob the Bank of El Paso, which has a disguised safe containing \"almost a million dollars.\" Manco arrives in the town and becomes aware of Mortimer, who had arrived earlier. He sees Mortimer deliberately insult the hunchback Wild, who is reconnoitering the bank. Manco confronts Mortimer, and after the two have studied each other, each ascertaining that the other will not back down, they decide to work together. Mortimer persuades Manco to join Indio\\'s gang and \"get him between two fires.\" Manco achieves this by freeing a friend of Indio from prison despite Indio\\'s suspicions.\\nIndio sends Manco and three others to rob the bank in nearby Santa Cruz. Manco guns down the three bandits and sends a false telegraphic alarm to rouse the El Paso sheriff and his posse, who ride to Santa Cruz. The gang blasts the wall at the rear of the El Paso bank and steals the safe, but is unable to open it. Groggy is angry when Manco is the only one to return from Santa Cruz, but Indio accepts Manco\\'s version of events thanks to Mortimer having given Manco a convincing neck wound. The gang ride to the small border town of Agua Caliente where Mortimer, who had anticipated their destination, is waiting. Wild recognizes Mortimer, forcing a showdown that results in the hunchback\\'s death, whereafter Mortimer offers his services to Indio to crack open the safe without using explosives. Indio locks the money in a strongbox and says the loot will be divided after a month.\\nManco and Mortimer break into the strongbox and hide the money, only to be caught immediately afterward and beaten up. Mortimer has secured the strongbox lock, however, and Indio believes that the money is still there. Later that night, Indio instructs his lieutenant, Niño, to use a knife belonging to Cuchillo to kill the man guarding Manco and Mortimer. Once Niño has freed the prisoners, Indio reveals that he knew they were bounty hunters all along, and executes Cuchillo for supposedly betraying the gang. Indio orders the rest of his men to bring back Manco and Mortimer, hoping they will all kill each other and he and Niño can split the money just between themselves. However, Groggy realizes the scheme, and after killing Niño, forces Indio to open the strongbox, which is found to be empty.\\nEventually, after he and Manco kill the bandits, Mortimer calls out Indio while revealing his full name. Mortimer shoots Groggy as he runs for cover, but is disarmed by Indio, who plays the pocket watch while challenging the bounty hunter to regain his weapon and kill him when the music ends. As the music ends, the same tune begins from an identical pocket watch that Manco had pilfered from Mortimer. Manco gives his gunbelt and pistol to Mortimer, saying, \"Now we start.\" When the music ends, Mortimer shoots first, killing Indio.\\nMortimer retrieves the watch from Indio\\'s hand and Manco remarks on Mortimer\\'s resemblance to the woman in the vignette photo inside the watch cover. Mortimer reveals that he is her brother (father in the Spanish dubbing), and with his revenge complete, declines his share of the bounty and leaves. Manco tosses the bodies of Indio and his men into a wagon, finally adding Groggy\\'s body after killing him, and rides off to collect the bounties on them all, briefly pausing to recover the stolen money from its hiding place.\\n'},\n",

The two share an appreciation for composers Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert, and he attempts to apply to the conservatory to be her pupil.

Despite this, Walter is admitted as Erika's pupil. Meanwhile, another pupil, Anna Schober, struggles with anxiety while pushed by her own ambitious mother. However, when Erika witnesses Anna and Walter socializing, she slips to an empty coatroom and smashes a glass, hiding the shards inside one of Anna's coat pockets.

Later at the conservatory, Erika feigns sympathy for Anna's mother, with Erika saying only she can substitute for Anna in the upcoming school concert at such a late stage.\\nWalter is increasingly insistent in his desire to initiate a sexual relationship with Erika, but Erika is only willing if he will satisfy her masochistic fantasies. She gives him the letter indicating acts she will consent to. He follows her home and reads the letter in her bedroom, but the list repulses him and he leaves. Later that night, Erika's mother is berating her while they lay in bed together for letting Walter in her bedroom in the middle of the night, when Erika suddenly begins kissing and groping her mother. Her mother resists and tells Erika she is unwell.\\nErika finds Walter at an ice rink after his hockey practice to apologize. She begins to subjugate herself to him in a janitorial closet. Walter says he loves her and they begin to have sex, but Erika is unable to, and vomits while performing fellatio.

He locks her mother away in her bedroom before proceeding to beat and rape Erika.\\nThe next day, Erika brings a large kitchen knife to the concert where she is scheduled to substitute for Anna. When Walter arrives, he enters cheerfully, laughing with his family, and flippantly greets her.

Based on Yann Martel\\'s 2001 novel of the same name, it stars Suraj Sharma, Irrfan Khan, Tabu, Rafe Spall, Gérard Depardieu and Adil Hussain in lead roles. The storyline revolves around two survivors of a shipwreck who are on a lifeboat stranded in the Pacific Ocean for 227 days. One is a sixteen-year-old Indian boy named Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) and the other is a ferocious Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.\\nThe film began development shortly after the release of the book and would see directors M. Night Shyamalan, Alfonso Cuarón and Jean-Pierre Jeunet involved at various stages before the hiring of Lee. Filming was split between India, Taiwan and Montreal in 2011, with Rhythm & Hues Studios (R&H) handling the visual effects work.\\nThe film had its worldwide premiere as the opening film of the 50th New York Film Festival at both the Walter Reade Theater and Alice Tully Hall in New York City on September 28, 2012. It was theatrically released in the U.S. on November 21 by 20th Century Fox. Life of Pi became a commercial success, having grossed over $609 million. Critics praised Lee\\'s direction, the screenplay, the editing, the music, the sound design and especially the effects and the cinematography. It was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, including Best Picture – Drama and Best Director, and won for Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. At the 85th Academy Awards it had eleven nominations, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, and won four, including Best Director for Ang Lee.\\n\\nPlot: In Canada a writer meets Pi Patel, who he has been told would be a good subject for a book. Pi tells the writer the following story:\\nPi\\'s father names him Piscine Molitor Patel after Piscine Molitor, a famous French swimming pool. In secondary school in Pondicherry, he adopts the Greek letter \"Pi\" as his nickname to avoid bullying. He is raised in a polytheistic Hindu family, but at 12 years old, he is introduced to Christianity and then Islam, and decides to follow all three religions as he \"just wants to love God\". His mother supports his desire to grow, but his rationalist father tries to secularize him. Pi\\'s family owns a zoo, and Pi takes interest in a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. After Pi gets dangerously close to Richard Parker, his father forces him to witness the tiger killing a goat.\\nWhen Pi is 16, his father announces that due to \"The Emergency\", they must move to Canada, where he intends to settle and sell the animals. The family books passage with the animals on a Japanese freighter. During a storm, the ship founders while Pi is on deck. He struggles to find his family, but a crewman throws him into a lifeboat. A freed plains zebra jumps onto the boat with him, breaking its leg. The ship sinks into the Mariana Trench, drowning his family. \\nAfter the storm, Pi awakens in the lifeboat with the zebra and is joined by a bornean orangutan. A spotted hyena emerges from under a tarpaulin, forcing Pi to retreat to the end of the boat. The hyena kills the zebra and later the orangutan. Richard Parker suddenly comes out from under the tarpaulin, killing the hyena before retreating back to cover.\\nPi fashions a small raft which he tethers to the lifeboat to be safe from Richard Parker. Despite his moral code against killing, he begins fishing, enabling him to sustain the tiger. When the tiger jumps into the sea to hunt for fish and then swims toward Pi, Pi considers letting him drown, but ultimately helps him into the boat. One night, a humpback whale destroys the raft and its supplies. Pi trains Richard Parker to accept him in the boat and realizes that caring for the tiger is helping to keep himself alive.\\nWeeks later, they encounter a floating island. It is a lush jungle of edible plants, freshwater pools and a large population of meerkats, enabling Pi and Richard Parker to eat, drink and regain strength. At night, the island transforms into a hostile environment. Richard Parker retreats to the lifeboat while Pi and the meerkats sleep in the trees; the water pools turn acidic. Pi deduces that the island is carnivorous after finding a human tooth embedded in a flower.\\nPi and Richard Parker leave the island, reaching Mexico after over 200 days at sea. Pi is heartbroken that Richard Parker does not acknowledge him before disappearing into the jungle. While Pi recovers in a hospital, insurance agents for the Japanese freighter company interview him, but do not believe his story and ask what really happened, specifically concerning why the ship sank. He tells a different story, in which the animals are replaced by humans: his mother for the orangutan, an amiable Buddhist sailor for the zebra, the ship\\'s brutish cook for the hyena, and Pi himself for Richard Parker. The cook kills the sailor and feeds on his flesh. He then kills Pi\\'s mother, after which Pi kills him and uses his remains as food and fish bait. The insurance agents are dissatisfied with this story but leave without questioning Pi further.\\nWhen the writer recognizes the animal story may be an allegory for the human story, Pi says that it does not matter which story is true because his family died either way, and neither story provides the explanation the insurance company wanted. He asks which story the author prefers, and the author chooses the first, to which Pi replies, \"and so it goes with God\". Glancing at a copy of the insurance report, the writer reads that Pi survived his adventure \"in the company of an adult Bengal tiger.\"\\n'},\n",

Helping the couple are Jacinto, the groundskeeper, and his fiancée Conchita, a teacher. Casares and Carmen support the Republican loyalists, and are hiding a large cache of gold being used to back the Republican treasury; the orphanage has also been subject to attacks from Francisco Franco\\'s troops, and an inert bomb sits in the courtyard.\\nOne day, an orphan named Carlos arrives with Ayala and Domínguez, two loyalists. Casares and Carmen take Carlos in, and he soon strikes up a friendship with Jaime, the orphanage bully, as well as Galvez and Owl. However, Carlos soon begins having visions of a mysterious entity, and hears stories about a child named Santi who went missing on the day the bomb was dropped in the courtyard. On his first night at the orphanage, Carlos is dared by Jaime to sneak to the kitchen for water after curfew, and Carlos counters by daring Jaime to go with him. The boys reach the kitchen, but Jaime hurries out after filling his pitcher, leaving Carlos alone. Carlos hears a whisper telling him that \"many of you will die.\" Frightened, Carlos rushes outside, but is caught by Jacinto. The next morning, Casares asks who snuck out after curfew but Carlos claims he went alone. This, as well as Carlos saving Jaime from falling in a cistern, earns him Jaime\\'s friendship.\\nJacinto knows of the gold hidden at the orphanage, and uses his affair with Carmen as an opportunity to take her keys and search for the treasure. That night, the boys hear strange noises and Carlos decides to investigate. He sneaks out, and encounters a pale figure of a young boy with a bleeding wound on his head, which causes him to run back into the building. Later, after flipping through Jaime\\'s sketchbook, Carlos finds a drawing of a ghostly figure labeled \"Santi\", leading him to suspect that Jaime knows more than the other boys.\\nCasares sees that Ayala has been captured by the nationalists. Fearing Ayala will soon be tortured into revealing the gold’s location at the orphanage, he convinces Carmen that they must evacuate the children immediately. Jacinto overhears the conversation and confronts Carmen, demanding the stash of gold and crassly bringing up their affair in front of Casares. Enraged, Casares points a gun at Jacinto and forces him to leave.\\nAs the orphans and faculty prepare to leave, Conchita discovers Jacinto pouring gasoline around the kitchen. She shoots him in the arm after he mocks her, causing a furious Jacinto to start a fire before fleeing the building. Carmen and fellow teacher Alma attempt to put out the fire, but fail to prevent an explosion; Alma is killed by the blast, as are several of the children. Casares finds a mortally wounded Carmen inside the building, and tearfully stays with her as she dies. Casares decides to remain in the charred orphanage with the surviving children, arming himself for Jacinto\\'s return.\\nThe following night, Jaime reveals to Carlos the details of Santi\\'s disappearance: Jaime and Santi had been collecting slugs at the cistern, when they spotted Jacinto attempting to open the safe where the gold was kept. Jaime managed to escape, but Jacinto cornered Santi and attempted to threaten him into keeping silent. In anger, Jacinto shoved Santi against a stone wall, giving him a severe head injury and sending him into shock. A panicked Jacinto then tied stones to Santi before sinking his body in the cistern. A terrified Jaime then ran into the courtyard, only to have the bomb land several feet from him moments later.\\nJaime insists that he is no longer scared of Jacinto, and will kill him if he returns. Conchita attempts to walk to the nearest town for help when she encounters Jacinto and two associates driving back to the orphanage to claim the gold. Jacinto threatens her with a knife, telling her to apologize for shooting him, but she insults him instead, and he stabs her to death.\\nCarlos has a final encounter with Santi\\'s ghost, who he is no longer afraid of after hearing the circumstances of his death. The ghost quietly demands that Carlos bring Jacinto to him.\\nCasares dies of his injuries as Jacinto and his associates reach the orphanage and imprison the orphans while they search for the gold.

Meanwhile, Jaime encourages the children to fight back, and they fashion weapons from sharpened sticks and broken glass. The ghost of Casares then comes to free them, unlocking the door, leaving behind a monogrammed handkerchief.

       "  'Description': 'Django (/ˈdʒæŋɡoʊ/ JANG-goh)[5] is a 1966 Spaghetti Western film directed and co-written by Sergio Corbucci, starring Franco Nero (in his breakthrough role) as the title character alongside Loredana Nusciak, José Bódalo, Ángel Álvarez and Eduardo Fajardo.[6] The film follows a Union soldier-turned-drifter and his companion, a mixed-race prostitute, who become embroiled in a bitter, destructive feud between a gang of Confederate Red Shirts and a band of Mexican revolutionaries. Intended to capitalize on and rival the success of Sergio Leone\\'s A Fistful of Dollars, Corbucci\\'s film is, like Leone\\'s, considered to be a loose, unofficial adaptation of Akira Kurosawa\\'s Yojimbo.[2][7][8]\\nThe film earned a reputation as one of the most violent films ever made at the time, and was subsequently refused a certificate in the United Kingdom until 1993, when it was issued an 18 certificate (the film was downgraded to a 15 certificate in 2004). A commercial success upon release, Django has garnered a large cult following outside of Italy and is widely regarded as one of the best films of the Spaghetti Western genre, with the direction, Nero\\'s performance, and Luis Bacalov\\'s soundtrack most frequently being praised.\\nAlthough the name is referenced in over 30 \"sequels\" from the time of the film\\'s release until the early 1970s in an effort to capitalize on the success of the original, most of these films were unofficial, featuring neither Corbucci nor Nero. Nero reprised his role as Django in 1987\\'s Django Strikes Again, the only official sequel produced with Corbucci\\'s involvement. Nero also made a cameo appearance in Quentin Tarantino\\'s 2012 film Django Unchained, an homage to Corbucci\\'s original. A TV series of the same name was released in 2023. Retrospective critics and scholars of Corbucci\\'s Westerns have also deemed Django to be the first in the director\\'s \"Mud and Blood\" trilogy, which also includes The Great Silence and The Specialists.[9]\\n\\nPlot: On the Mexico–United States border, Django, wearing a Union uniform and dragging a coffin, witnesses Mexican bandits tying a prostitute, María, to a bridge and whipping her. The bandits are dispatched by henchmen of Major Jackson – a racist ex-Confederate officer – who prepare to kill María by crucifying her atop a burning cross. Django shoots the men, and offers María protection. The pair arrive in a town, populated by Nathaniel, a bartender, and five prostitutes.

       "  'Description': \"Captain Phillips is a 2013 American biographical action thriller film[4][5][6] directed by Paul Greengrass. Based on the 2009 Maersk Alabama hijacking, the film tells the story of the eponymous Captain Richard Phillips, an American merchant mariner who was taken hostage by Somali pirates. It stars Tom Hanks as Phillips, alongside Barkhad Abdi as pirate leader Abduwali Muse.\\nThe screenplay by Billy Ray is based on Phillips's 2010 book A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea, which Phillips co-wrote with Stephan Talty. Scott Rudin, Dana Brunetti and Michael De Luca served as producers on the project. It premiered at the 2013 New York Film Festival,[7] and was theatrically released on October 11, 2013. The film emerged as a critical and commercial success, receiving positive reviews from critics and grossing $220 million against a budget of $55 million. Captain Phillips received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Abdi.[8][9]\\n\\nPlot: In 2009, Richard Phillips takes command of MV Maersk Alabama, an unarmed container vessel from the Port of Salalah in Oman, with orders to sail through the Guardafui Channel to Mombasa, Kenya. Meanwhile, pirates, including a skinny young man named Muse, are ordered to go back to sea. Muse chooses a crew for his skiff, including Bilal, an eager teenager, and Elmi, who offers to steer, and the aggressive Najee. Wary of pirate activity off the coast of the Horn of Africa, Phillips and First Officer Shane Murphy order strict security precautions on the vessel and carry out a practice drill. During the drill, the captain notices that the vessel is being followed by Somali pirates in two skiffs, and Phillips calls for help. Knowing that the pirates are listening to radio traffic, he pretends to call a warship, requesting immediate air support. One skiff, piloted by rival Asad, turns around in response, and the other – crewed by four heavily armed pirates led by Abduwali Muse – loses engine power trying to steer through Maersk Alabama's wake. Later that night, over an argument, Muse grabs a wrench, and bludgeons Asad over the head, impressing Najee and shocking Bilal.\\nThe next day, Muse's skiff, now fitted with two outboard engines, returns with the same four pirates aboard. Despite the efforts of Phillips and his crew, the pirates secure their ladder to the ship. As they board, Phillips tells the crew to hide in the engine room, just before the pirates storm the bridge and hold Phillips and the other crew members at gunpoint. Phillips offers Muse the $30,000 in the ship's safe, but Muse's orders are to ransom the ship and crew in exchange for millions of dollars of insurance money from the shipping company. While they search the ship, Phillips sees Shane and indirectly notes to him that the youngest pirate Bilal does not have sandals. Shane tells the crew to line the engine room hallway with broken glass. Chief Engineer Mike Perry deactivates the power to the ship, plunging the lower decks into darkness. Bilal cuts his feet when they reach the engine room, and Muse continues to search alone. The crew members ambush Muse, badly cutting his hand and holding him at knifepoint, and arrange to release him and the other pirates into a lifeboat. However, Muse's right-hand man Nour Najee refuses to board the lifeboat with Muse unless Phillips goes with them. Once all are on the lifeboat, Muse motions for Najee to strike Phillips in the back, forcing him into the vessel before the pirates launch the boat with all five of them on board. As it hits the water, Najee strikes his head and Muse loses balance.\\nAs the lifeboat heads for Somalia, tensions flare between the pirates as they run low on the plant-based amphetamine khat that they have been eating, and they lose contact with their mother ship. In cramped quarters, Muse bangs his injured hand and noticing the first aid kit, Phillips treats Bilal’s wounded foot, but Najee yells at him to stop before the wound is fully bandaged. The pirates deny Phillips water and fresh air but Bilal, hands him water, a move disapproved by Najee. Conditions on the lifeboat worsen. Bilal cannot feel his foot, and Elmi smashes a window for air. Muse says that he stole $6 million from a Greek ship last year, when Phillips wonders why he is not rich, Najee loses his temper and begins to question Muse’s leadership when they are intercepted by the U.S. Navy destroyer USS\\xa0Bainbridge. Bainbridge's captain Frank Castellano is ordered to prevent the pirates from reaching the Somali coast by any means. When two boats arrive at the lifeboat with supplies, the Navy officers demand to see Phillips. When he emerges at gunpoint, he shouts that he is at “Seat Fifteen,” indicating the place where the pirates are holding him inside. The boats leave after an impatient Najee fires his gun, to the dismay of his fellow pirates. Even when additional ships arrive, a desperate Muse asserts that he has come too far and will not surrender. The negotiators are unable to change his mind, and a team from DEVGRU parachutes in to intervene, while Phillips attempts to escape from the lifeboat before being quickly recaptured and beaten and choked by Najee and pistol-whipped by Muse.\\nWhile three DEVGRU marksmen get into positions, Castellano and DEVGRU continue to try to find a peaceful solution, eventually taking the lifeboat under tow. Muse agrees to board Bainbridge, where he is told that his clan elders are arriving to negotiate Phillips's ransom. In the lifeboat, Phillips begins to write a letter to his family, as Bilal pleads for him to stop due to Najee’s paranoia. Najee spots Phillips writing the letter and snatches it, accusing it of being a Navy trick. A provoked Phillips wrestles and overpowers Najee with relative ease and punches him in the stomach and tries to choke him. Though Phillips has the upper hand, Elmi urges the hesitant Bilal to strike Phillips in the back with his AK-47. After a brief struggle, the three pirates get a hold of Phillips and the enraged Najee beats Phillips further and orders his fellow pirates to tie up and blindfold Phillips, who says his final goodbyes to his family over the audio. Najee berates Bilal and Elmi for their protests, stating that they've been tricked by the Navy as the elders did not come to negotiate and that they will all die anyway and that Phillips is the source of their misfortune. As Elmi looks on helplessly and Bilal lowers his head, and Najee prepares to shoot Phillips, Bainbridge's crew stops the tow, causing Najee to lose balance, spoiling his aim and making Phillips swing back out of range. This gives the marksmen three clear shots, by which they simultaneously shoot all three pirates: Elmi is hit in the face and makes a guttural sound, Bilal is hit in the neck and makes a choking noise and Najee is hit in the spinal cord. All three slump down, blood splattering Phillips. Phillips takes off the blindfold to see Najee’s dead cold eyes and Elmi fallen dead and the dying Bilal gasping for breath. A despondent Muse is arrested and taken into custody for piracy where he is told his crew are dead. Navy SEALS rescue Phillips from the lifeboat and his injuries are treated. Although in shock and disoriented, he thanks the rescue team for saving his life.\\n\"},\n",

This is Ledger\\'s final film performance and was dedicated to him and co-producer William Vince.\\nIts world premiere was during the 62nd Cannes Film Festival, out of competition.[6] The film, which cost $30 million to make, grossed more than $60 million in its worldwide theatrical release.\\nIt was nominated for two Academy Awards. The first was Best Art Direction with art directed by Dave Warren and Anastasia Masaro, and set decorated by Caroline Smith; and it lost to Avatar. The second was Best Costume Design with costumes designed by Monique Prudhomme; and it lost to The Young Victoria.[7]\\n\\nPlot: Outside a London pub, an elderly bearded sage named Doctor Parnassus runs a nearly bankrupt travelling theatre troupe, which includes his teenage daughter Valentina, a sleight-of-hand expert and barker Anton, and a dwarf assistant Percy. The troupe\\'s main attraction is a portal to a magical \"Imaginarium\", a surreal dream world that transforms according to its participants\\' own desires and offers them a choice between difficult self-fulfillment or easy ignorance. After a drunkard is swayed to the latter, Parnassus says he has lost \"another one\" to Mr. Nick, a suave personification of the Devil, who often appears without warning to taunt Parnassus and gloat over Parnassus\\'s failures. He reminds Parnassus that in three days Valentina turns 16, and her soul will belong to Mr. Nick. Hundreds of years ago, Mr. Nick tricked Parnassus into accepting immortality, after making a wager similar to his current predicament.\\nAs the troupe crosses a bridge, Anton notices someone hanging beneath it. After they rescue the man and revive him, he spits out a golden pipe that allowed him to continue breathing while being hanged; unwilling to explain his past, the man convinces his rescuers that he has amnesia. Parnassus sadly contemplates the impending loss of his daughter, and Mr. Nick visits him, revealing the identity of the rescued man: a disgraced philanthropist named Tony Shepard, who was being hanged by Russian gangsters for owing them money. Mr. Nick also offers Parnassus a new wager: Valentina can stay with Parnassus past the age of 16 if Parnassus can win five souls to the path of self-fulfillment before Mr. Nick can win five souls to the path of ignorance, all within the universe of the Imaginarium.\\nThe newcomer Tony soon joins the troupe as a barker even more charismatic than Anton, who is becoming suspicious. Tony convinces the troupe to remodel the show into a more modern act. While performing, Tony lures a posh, affluent woman into the Imaginarium and follows her, where they enter a pastel-coloured dream-world representing the woman\\'s imagination. The woman\\'s imagination also changes Tony\\'s face to one of her liking; Tony dances elegantly with her, and they notice a motel run by Mr. Nick, but Tony convinces the woman instead to take a gondola ride that wins the first soul for Parnassus. Tony falls back out of the Imaginarium, returning his face to normal. The woman exits shortly after and gives the troupe a vast sum of money as thanks for her marvellous experience. When three other women enter, each re-emerges elated; and thus, Parnassus has won a total of four souls. However, Mr. Nick easily takes the souls of four Russian gangsters looking to hunt Tony down for his debts. They chase Tony into the Imaginarium and quickly fall into a trap laid by Mr. Nick. Thus, the score is tied: four to four.\\nWith the bet nearing its end, Parnassus reluctantly reveals to Valentina her secret origins: after aging from immortality, Parnassus made a new pact with Mr. Nick to be youthful again, in order to win the heart of a woman he loved. In exchange, any child he fathered would become Mr. Nick\\'s property at the age of 16. Valentina is horrified at her father\\'s revelation. Meanwhile, having discovered that Tony is a fraudulent charity scammer who stole organs from orphans in developing countries and sold them to wealthy westerners, Anton confronts Tony, but Tony fights him off, pushes Valentina into the Imaginarium, and joins her. Influenced by Valentina\\'s romantic desires, Tony\\'s face changes to that of her dream lover, and they float along a beautiful river in a gondola, fulfilling their shared sexual feelings. A child in rags disrupts their serene boat trip, transitioning the scene to one of Tony as a philanthropist, speaking at a fundraiser for impoverished children. Anton, following the pair into the Imaginarium, appears in the form of an outspoken child and exposes Tony as a fraud. A mob of angry benefactors pursues Tony, and, as the landscape disintegrates, Anton confesses his love for Valentina before falling into a void.\\nDistraught and angry over her father\\'s bargain and a lifetime of hiding the truth from her, Valentina willingly gives her soul over to Mr. Nick even though he himself tries to dissuade her. Disillusioned by the easy victory, Mr. Nick offers Parnassus yet another bargain: to trade Valentina\\'s soul for Tony\\'s. Therefore, as the mob approaches Tony to hang him, Parnassus presents Tony with his true sturdy golden pipe that will allow him to survive the hanging as well as a near-perfect but brittle replica. Parnassus hopes that Tony will choose wrong; indeed, Tony inserts the cheap replica in his windpipe and thus dies when the mob lynches him. Mr. Nick keeps his word, freeing Valentina\\'s soul but not revealing her new location to Parnassus, who is abandoned to wander in despair for years, trapped in his own Imaginarium.\\nOne day, Parnassus looks up to find himself a pitiful beggar back in London, when Valentina suddenly walks by him. He sees that she is now happily married to Anton, and they have a daughter. As Parnassus watches them through a window, his old assistant Percy walks up to him, dissuading him from interrupting Valentina\\'s new cheerful life. Parnassus finally seems to be at peace, just knowing that his daughter is happy. Soon, Parnassus and Percy have teamed up again, presenting toy theatres of the Imaginarium and the troupe on a street corner. As Mr. Nick appears one final time to beckon Parnassus over to him for a new bargain, Percy quickly intervenes, ordering Parnassus back to work.\\n'},\n",

Chow explains his plan to retrieve the stolen gold from the basement of a Mexican villa he previously owned.\\nThey break into the house and successfully retrieve the gold, but Chow double-crosses them, locking them in the basement, rearming the security system and escaping in Phil\\'s minivan. They are arrested, but mysteriously released from the police station. They are picked up by a limousine and taken back to the villa, where they find Marshall. They learn that Chow had lied to them: the villa was in fact Marshall\\'s the whole time and the gold they stole was the other half Chow did not get from Marshall. He spares the group for the oversight but kills \"Black Doug\" and reminds them of their now two-day deadline.\\nThey track Phil\\'s phone, which was left in the minivan, and find it left outside a pawn shop in Las Vegas. The owner, Cassie, tells them that Chow traded a gold brick for only $18,000, far less than its actual $400,000 value and gives them a business card for an escort service Chow is using. Using Stu\\'s former lover Jade as their contact, they learn that Chow is barricaded in the penthouse suite of Caesars Palace. Phil and Alan sneak into his suite from the roof, but Chow escapes, jumping from the balcony and parachuting down to the Strip. Stu catches up to Chow and locks him in the trunk of Marshall\\'s limousine. They take the gold and meet with Marshall, who releases Doug when they reveal they cannot secure the original half as Chow lost it all in Bangkok. Although Marshall had promised not to harm Chow, he shoots up the trunk of the car, presumably killing him.\\nHowever, Alan had given Chow the means to escape from the trunk through a backseat compartment just moments earlier. Chow emerges from the limo and kills Marshall and his bodyguard, but spares Phil and Stu because Alan saved his life. He offers Alan a bar of gold as a gift, but Alan turns him down and ends their friendship because of Chow\\'s unhealthy influence on the group. As Chow sadly watches them leave, they go to retrieve Phil\\'s minivan from the pawnshop and Alan makes a date with Cassie. Six months later, they marry and Alan resigns from the Wolfpack.\\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Wolfpack plus Cassie appear to have staged another wild party that they can\\'t remember. Stu now has breast implants and Alan remembers that the wedding cake was a gift from Chow. Chow emerges from the bathroom naked, carrying a katana. The chain-smoking Bangkok monkey drops from the ceiling onto Stu, startling him.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'Never Let Me Go is a 2011 British dystopian romantic tragedy film based on Kazuo Ishiguro\\'s 2005 novel of the same name. The film was directed by Mark Romanek from a screenplay by Alex Garland. Never Let Me Go is set in an alternative history and centres on Kathy, Ruth and Tommy portrayed by Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield, respectively, who become entangled in a love triangle. Principal photography began in April 2010. Filming locations included Andrew Melville Hall and Forest School, Walthamstow.[2] The film was produced by DNA Films and Film4 on a US$15 million budget.\\nPrior to the book\\'s publication, Garland had approached Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich about a possible film, and wrote a 96-page script. The producers initially had trouble finding an actress to play Kathy. Mulligan was cast in the role after Peter Rice, the head of the company financing the film, recommended her by text message while watching her performance in An Education. Mulligan, a fan of the book, enthusiastically accepted the role, as she had long desired to play the part. The film\\'s message and themes were the factors that attracted Garfield to the film.\\nNever Let Me Go premiered at the 37th annual Telluride Film Festival in September 2011, where the audience responded positively to its message. The film was also screened at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival, and it opened the 54th London Film Festival. The film was distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures to cinemas in the United States on 15 September 2011, where it was given a limited release. It opened on 14 January 2012 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Never Let Me Go opened at four theatres, grossing over US$111,000 during its first weekend. The movie got off to a better start in its first weekend in the UK, earning £625,000 and taking ninth place at the box office.\\nNever Let Me Go earned US$9.5 million at the box office and an additional US$1.89 million in DVD sales revenue. Never Let Me Go was met with generally positive reviews from film critics, with most reviewers praising its portrayals.\\n\\nPlot: A medical breakthrough in 1952 has permitted the human lifespan to be extended beyond 100 years. In 1978, the young Kathy H, along with her friends Tommy and Ruth, spend their childhood at a boarding school named Hailsham. The students are encouraged to create artwork, and their best work gets into The Gallery run by a mysterious woman known only as Madame. One day, a new teacher, Miss Lucy, quietly informs the students of their fate: they are destined to be organ donors and will die, or \"complete\", in their early adulthood. Shortly afterward she is fired by the headmistress, Miss Emily, for sharing this revelation with the children. As time passes, Kathy falls in love with Tommy, but Ruth and Tommy begin a relationship and stay together throughout the rest of their time at Hailsham.\\nIn 1985, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy, now teenagers, are rehoused in cottages on a farm. They are permitted to leave the grounds on day trips, but are resigned to their eventual fate. At the farm, they meet former pupils of schools similar to theirs, and it is revealed that they are all clones. They also hear rumours of the possibility of \"deferral\"—a temporary reprieve from organ donation for donors who are in love and can prove it. Tommy becomes convinced that The Gallery at Hailsham was intended to look into their souls and that artwork sent to The Gallery will be able to confirm true love where it is present. The relationship between Tommy and Ruth becomes sexual, and Ruth confronts Kathy, telling her Tommy never thought of her as more than a friend. This causes Kathy and Ruth to end their friendship. The lonely Kathy leaves and becomes a \"carer\"—a donor who is given a temporary reprieve from donation as a reward for supporting and comforting donors as they are made to give up their organs. Tommy and Ruth\\'s relationship ends but Kathy has already begun her training.\\nIn 1994, Kathy is still working as a carer, and has watched many donors gradually die as their organs are harvested. Kathy, who has not seen Ruth or Tommy since the farm, discovers Ruth, frail after two donations. They find Tommy, who is also weakened by his donations, and they take a drive to the seashore, where Ruth admits that she did not love Tommy, and only seduced him because she was afraid to be alone. She is consumed with guilt and has been searching for a way to help Tommy and Kathy. She believes that the rumours of \"deferral\" are true, and has found the address of the gallery owner, Madame, who she thinks may grant deferrals to couples in love. Ruth dies on the operating table shortly afterward.\\nKathy and Tommy finally begin a relationship. Tommy explains to Kathy that he has been creating art in the hope that it will aid deferral. He and Kathy drive to visit Madame, who lives with the headmistress of Hailsham. The two teachers tell them that there is no such thing as deferral, and that Tommy\\'s artworks will not help him. They explain that the purpose of The Gallery was not to look into their souls but to investigate whether the \"all but human\" donors even have souls at all; Hailsham was the last place to consider the ethical implications of the donor scheme. As they take in the news on their return journey, Tommy explodes in rage and frustration, and they cling to each other in grief. Tommy completes his final donation and dies on the operating table, leaving Kathy alone, waiting for her donations to begin in a month. Contemplating the ruins of her childhood, she asks in voice-over whether her fate is really any different from the people who will receive her organs; after all, \"we all complete\".\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'Cowboy Bebop: The Movie, known in Japan as Cowboy Bebop: Knockin\\' on Heaven\\'s Door (Japanese: カウボーイビバップ 天国の扉, Hepburn: Kaubōi Bibappu: Tengoku no Tobira, lit. Cowboy Bebop: Heaven\\'s Door), is a 2001 Japanese anime science fiction action film based on the 1998 anime series Cowboy Bebop created by Hajime Yatate. Multiple staff from the original series worked on the film, including director Shinichirō Watanabe; writer Keiko Nobumoto; character designer/animation director Toshihiro Kawamoto; and composer Yoko Kanno. Both the original Japanese and English voice cast also reprised their roles.\\nCowboy Bebop: The Movie is set between episodes 22 and 23 of the original series.[3] The plot centers on a mysterious terrorist planning to destroy the human population on Mars using an unknown pathogen. The bounty hunter crew of the spaceship Bebop work to find the terrorist and discover the pathogen\\'s source before the attack can take place.\\nThe film was conceived by Watanabe as an extension of his work on the television series, which he treated as a series of miniature films. So as not to alienate fans of the series, a large amount of aesthetic material was incorporated, while also adjusting it to make it accessible to newcomers. Increased budget and production facilities enabled the use of filming styles associated with live action films and a higher animation quality than the series. Arabic thematic elements were incorporated to contrast against the series, which entailed Watanabe traveling to Morocco for research. The Arabic atmosphere was also used in Kanno\\'s music.\\nThe film was produced by studios Sunrise, which had previously developed the original series; Bones, a later studio founded by former Sunrise staff; and Bandai Visual. Cowboy Bebop: The Movie was released to theaters in Japan on September 1, 2001, and in the United States on August 11, 2002. It went on to gross over $3 million worldwide, and when released on DVD, it ranked high on Japanese and US charts. The film received generally positive reviews from mainstream and anime critics, and was nominated for the Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Animated Film.\\n\\nPlot: On Mars in 2071, it\\'s been 49 years after Earth was mostly abandoned after a catastrophe. Humanity has settled on other planets and moons in the solar system. The film\\'s protagonists are legalized bounty hunters who travel together on the spaceship Bebop. They are Spike Spiegel, a former associate of the Red Dragon crime syndicate; Faye Valentine, a woman who was once a fugitive from bounty hunters; Jet Black, a former police officer and owner of the Bebop; Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV (Ed for short), a bubbly, energetic girl with genius computer skills; and Ein, an artificially enhanced \"data dog\" with human-level intelligence. \\nDays before Halloween, a man explodes a truck in Mars\\' capital city, spreading what is assumed to be a new pathogen that kills or sickens over 300 people. In response, the Mars government issues a massive bounty for the culprit\\'s capture. Faye, who was pursuing Lee Sampson, a hacker who was apparently driving the truck, sees the terrorist and the Bebop crew decide to take on the bounty. Each follows different lines of inquiry. Ed, using a tattoo on the attacker\\'s wrist, manages to identify him as Vincent Volaju, a former member of a military squad apparently killed in the Titan War. In reality, Vincent was the only survivor of a test involving the pathogen, having been immunized with a test vaccine: left with dissociative amnesia and hallucinations of glowing butterflies, his inability to tell dreams from reality eventually drove him insane.\\nJet learns that the truck was the property of Cherious Medical Pharmaceutical Company, who illegally manufactured the pathogen as a biological weapon. Looking for information on the pathogen, Spike is given a sample by a man named Rashid, who was the former lead on its development. Spike also encounters Elektra Ovilo, an agent of Cherious Medical. Upon examination, the \"pathogen\" proves to be a type of protein-based nanomachine that mimics human lymphocytes then breaks down into protein after death, making it undetectable. Attempting to infiltrate Cherious Medical, Spike fights with Elektra, planting a listening device on her. Elektra, who is sent by Cherious Medical to kill Vincent, is tailed by Spike, who attempts to take down Vincent on a train.\\nVincent easily defeats Spike, severely wounding him and throwing him from the train before releasing another cloud of the nanomachines: everyone in the train dies except Elektra, who was unknowingly immunized when she had been in a relationship with Vincent prior to the test on Titan. Elektra secretly gives a friend in the company a sample of her blood to prepare a stock of vaccine. During this time, Faye relocates Sampson, who has been working with Vincent, but fails to catch him. Ein and Ed manage to find him again, but the two run off before Faye can get there. She arrives just as Vincent breaks one of the nanomachine containers with him, killing Sampson. Although Faye is also infected, Vincent gives her some of his blood through a kiss, immunizing her. \\nAfter Spike recovers and has a final talk with Rashid, he and Elektra are captured by Cherious Medical, who want to suppress all knowledge of the nanomachines\\' existence. The two escape from Cherious Medical, grabbing the newly produced vaccine on the way. In turn, Faye escapes after Vincent goes to trigger an attack on the city that will eventually kill everyone on Mars. After the group reunites, it is determined that Vincent will spread the nanomachines by exploding the giant jack-o\\'-lantern balloons used in the Halloween parade. Jet has a troop of old crop dusters spread the vaccine over the city while Faye heads for the weather control center and causes it to rain on the city, aiding the spread of the vaccine. \\nSpike and Elektra separately head to confront Vincent. Spike arrives first and the two battle to a standstill, then the nanomachines are released and Spike is temporarily weakened by them (before he gets cured with the vaccine). As Vincent prepares to kill Spike, Elektra arrives and shoots Vincent. Having wanted to die since Titan, Vincent does not defend himself and thanks Elektra for their time together before dying.\\n'},\n",

It stars Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jason Patric as two cops in the 1970s who go undercover on a case. They become drug addicts themselves and, under pressure from the chief of police, falsified evidence in some cases. The book and film are both based on a 1978-79 drug scandal involving the Tyler, Texas police department and Smith County, Texas Sheriff's Office. An FBI investigation led to the book's author and her partner pleading guilty to perjury, serving time in federal prison, and testifying in a federal civil rights case against Tyler, Texas police chief Willie Hardy, who was found not guilty by a jury of his peers in Smith County, Texas.[2][3]\\n\\nPlot: Seasoned undercover narcotics officer Jim Raynor is told by his superior, Lt. Dodd, to choose a partner from a group of recent police academy graduates for a planned undercover investigation. Raynor chooses the only woman applicant, Kristen Cates. Though uneasy, Dodd approves Raynor's choice.\\nRaynor explains to Cates that they will be deep undercover, dependent on each other to try not to get killed during the investigation. Though initially startled by Raynor's intensity, Cates insists she is capable of doing whatever it takes to get the job done. Later at Raynor's apartment, he teaches Cates how to inject drugs, claiming that he is using a harmless powder for demonstration purposes. Raynor informs Cates that she will be put in situations where she will have to take the drugs in order to convince dealers she is not a cop. He insists that if she tries to fake drug use in front of dealers, she will get both of them killed.\\nThe main target of the operation is a local bar owner and pornographer, Will Gaines. The chief of police insists that Gaines is the main drug boss in the town, but Gaines is deeply mistrustful of Raynor and Cates.\\nAs Raynor predicted, Cates is put into a position where she is forced to inject drugs in front of a dealer. Over the course of the investigation, buying drugs all over town, Cates and Raynor begin using drugs for more reasons than maintaining their cover.\\nThough they have successfully infiltrated the town's drug underworld, Raynor and Cates are unable to make a buy from Gaines. Under pressure from the chief and sergeant, they falsify evidence against Gaines in order to secure his arrest.\\nThe night before Gaines trial is to begin, Cates is startled awake by a double barrel shotgun caressing her face. A gunfight ensues, in which Raynor is shot in the thigh, striking his femoral artery. Cates returns fire and runs to a neighbor's house shouting for help, then returns to the trailer to find Raynor barely conscious. He dies in her arms.\\nAt the grand jury, Cates is on the witness stand. During her testimony, she mentions that she has resigned from the police force. Her testimony sticks to the fabricated story Raynor and she concocted. Gaines is later indicted. However, at trial, Cates takes the stand to testify. When she looks directly at Gaines, he slides two fingers down the bridge of his nose, mimicking the movement of the shotgun that eventually killed Raynor. Stunned, Cates retracts her statements about Gaines's involvement in the drug trade, and testifies that they were ordered to fabricate evidence by the Chief of Police. This secures Gaines's acquittal.\\nFreed from police custody, Gaines gets into his car a few nights later. As he drives down the road, he notices someone hiding in the backseat. Gaines pulls over, and as he turns to confront them, he is killed by a double barrel shotgun blast to the face. The killer is never shown, but it is implied that it is Cates.\\n\"},\n",

Seven years later, the duo meets again at the police academy and become friends and partners on bicycle patrol. They catch a break when they arrest Domingo, the leader of a one-percenter motorcycle gang, but are forced to release him after they failed to read him his Miranda rights.\\nThe duo is reassigned to a revived scheme from the 1980s, which specializes in infiltrating high schools. Captain Dickson assigns them to contain the spread of a synthetic drug called HFS (\"Holy Fucking Shit\") at Sagan High School. He gives them new identities and enrolls them as students, giving them class schedules fitting their previous academic performances; Jenko taking mostly arts and humanities, and Schmidt taking mostly science classes, but the duo mixes up their identities.

The rift between the duo grows as their new school life intrudes upon their official police work. Schmidt and Jenko track Eric to a cash transaction with the distributors of HFS—the motorcycle gang from the park—and a chase ensues on the freeway. They return to school, argue, and eventually begin fighting, which disrupts the school play.

His ex-wife Pam\\'s arrogant second husband, Roy, offers to pay for the wedding, but Jimmy refuses and decides to sell his most prized possession, a one-of-a-kind 1952 baseball card, to come up with the money. The pawnshop is robbed by career criminal Dave, who takes the card. Finding out Dave is planning to rob a house that night, they stake it out to retrieve the card.

His humiliation is only furthered when Pam insists that both her husband and her ex give Ava away.

It depicts the effort that goes into making the magazine, and the passion that Grace Coddington, a former model turned creative director and the only person who dares to stand up to Anna Wintour, has for the highly regarded fashion magazine. In the film, Coddington is often portrayed as the leading victim to Wintour's aggressive personality.

A sequel is in the works and is scheduled to be released in late 2023. \\n\\nPlot: The film examines the modern food industry, and raises alarms about both the industrial production of meat (chicken, beef, and pork) and the modern methods used to grow grains and vegetables (primarily corn and soybeans). It discusses the dominance of the American food market by a handful of huge corporations, which work to keep consumers from being aware of how their food is produced and are largely successful in their efforts to avoid such things as stronger food safety laws, the unionization of their workers, and additional food labeling regulations. These companies promote unhealthy food consumption habits among the American public and then supply cheap, inadequately safety-tested, increasingly genetically-modified food that is produced and transported using methods that exploit livestock, employees, farmers, and the environment and use large amounts of petroleum products.[1][7] Eating organic, locally-grown food that is in season and reading product labels are offered as solutions, and the rapid growth of the organic food industry seen as providing hope for the future.\\n'},\n",

After youth orchestra rehearsals, Jenny waits at a bus stop on the street in the rain when she meets David Goldman, a seductive older man driving a Bristol 405. Telling her that he is a music lover and that he is worried about her cello getting wet, David convinces Jenny to put her cello in his car while she walks alongside. As the rain becomes stronger, Jenny asks David if she can sit inside his car. The two continue talking about music and, before being dropped off, Jenny confesses that she will be able to do whatever she wants when she reaches university, such as going to art galleries and watching French films, wishing for a life of culture and luxury. The following week, David leaves flowers on Jenny's front porch, wishing her luck at her youth orchestra's concert. Later, she sees him outside the cafe she and her friends are in and approaches him. After a little small talk, David asks Jenny if she is free to go see a concert and have supper with him and his friends. She happily agrees and thanks him.\\nOn the night of the concert, Jack disapproves of Jenny going while her much more lenient mother, Marjorie, tells him otherwise. David comes by to pick Jenny up and to talk to her parents, where he easily charms his way into convincing Jack that he take Jenny home later than her intended curfew. They arrive at the concert where Jenny meets David's friends, Danny and Helen. Afterward, they go to dinner at a fancy restaurant, where they invite Jenny to an art auction. David picks up Jenny at school and they go to the auction, winning a bid for a painting by Edward Burne-Jones and going to Danny's place afterwards. They talk about Oxford and they all agree to go and visit together the following weekend.\\nJenny hears a commotion late one night and sees David drinking with her parents. He then uses the opportunity to ask them if he can take Jenny to Oxford, saying that he used to study there and would like to visit his old teacher, Clive Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia. Her parents are reluctant at first, but agree, seeing it as a good opportunity. At Oxford, Jenny discovers that David is a con man who makes money through a variety of shady practices. She is initially shocked but silences her misgivings as she succumbs to David's charm. Back at her home, Jenny and David have their first kiss.

Shocked, Jenny tells David to take her and her parents back home. Jenny argues with David, telling him she gave up her education to be with him. David says he will get a divorce and agrees that he will go and tell her parents the truth with her. She then goes inside her house, her father asking what happened.

However, he drives off and is never seen again.\\nJenny despairs, blaming Danny and Helen for not telling her the truth early on and blaming her parents for letting her throw her life away with an older man. Jenny confronts David's wife, and learns that David is a serial adulterer, and has a son. Later that night, Jack apologizes to Jenny, admitting that he messed up and that he believed David could give her the life she wanted. Jack points out that although David wasn't who he said he was, Jenny had also deceived her parents about David's nature by playing along with some of David's lies to her parents. Jenny then goes back to her school, requesting to repeat her last year and take her exams, but is refused re-admission. She then goes to Miss Stubbs, asking for help.

It was released in the United States on DVD and Blu-ray on 14 August 2012.[10]\\nA sequel titled The Raid 2 was released in 2014. Both films showcase the traditional Indonesian martial art of pencak silat, with fight choreography led by Uwais and Yayan Ruhian. A third film was considered but Evans decided not to go forward with the project.[11][12]\\n\\nPlot: Rama is a rookie brimob officer who joins a 20-man squad led by Sergeant Jaka and Lieutenant Wahyu for a raid on an apartment block with the intent of arresting crime lord Tama Riyadi. Together with his lieutenants Andi and Mad Dog, Tama runs the block and allows criminals and addicts to rent rooms under his protection. Arriving undetected, the team sweeps the first floor and subdues various tenants; they also meet a law-abiding tenant named Gofar delivering medicine to his sick wife. Continuing to the sixth floor, the team is spotted by two young lookouts, one of whom raises the alarm after the other is shot.\\nTama calls in reinforcements, including a pair of snipers who pick off officers guarding the block's exterior and a group of gunmen who destroy the police truck. Taking advantage of the chaos outside, Tama's men set themselves free and regain control of the first five floors. Tama then cuts the lights and announces over the PA system that the rest of the officers are on the sixth-floor stairwell, and that he will grant permanent residence to those who kill them. Wahyu confesses to Jaka that he staged the mission to eliminate Tama, who is in league with corrupt police officials, including himself; the mission is not officially sanctioned by police command, and there will be no reinforcements. The remaining team members are ambushed by shooters from above and almost completely wiped out.\\nThe remaining officers—Rama, Bowo, Jaka, Wahyu, Dagu, Alee, Hanggi and one other—retreat to an empty apartment and are cornered by more armed thugs. Rama uses an axe to create a hole in the floor so the team can descend to the lower level. Dropping to the room below, the team struggles to fend off Tama's thugs; Alee, Hanggi, and another officer are killed, and Bowo is gravely wounded. Rama uses a propane tank and a refrigerator to construct an improvised explosive device that eliminates the invading henchmen. With more of Tama's reinforcements approaching, the team splits into two groups: Jaka, Dagu, and Wahyu retreat to the fifth floor, while Rama and Bowo ascend.\\nAfter fighting a group of assassins, Rama and Bowo locate Gofar's apartment, and Gofar reluctantly hides the officers inside. Gangs wielding machetes search the apartment but fail to find them. After tending to Bowo's wounds, Rama leaves to search for Jaka's group. Rama encounters the machete gang and defeats them in a long fight, tackling their leader through a window and plummeting onto a fire escape below. On the sixth floor, he finds Andi, who has murdered two of Tama's men. Andi is revealed to be his estranged brother, whom Rama signed up for the mission to search for, at the urging of their father. Rama refuses to leave the building without his comrades, and Andi refuses to abandon his criminal life. Rama parts ways with his brother to search for his surviving colleagues.\\nMad Dog discovers Jaka and his group on the fourth floor. Wahyu runs off, and Jaka instructs Dagu to protect him. Mad Dog challenges Jaka to hand-to-hand combat; he ultimately gains the upper hand and kills Jaka, by breaking his neck. Mad Dog then meets up with Andi to report back to Tama. Tama, having learned of Andi's treachery through his surveillance cameras, attacks and incapacitates Andi. Rama regroups with Dagu and Wahyu, and they head for Tama on the 15th floor, fighting through a narcotics lab along the way. Rama separates from Dagu and Wahyu when he discovers Mad Dog torturing Andi. Mad Dog lets Rama free Andi and fights them both. After a long and brutal fight, Mad Dog is ultimately killed by Rama and Andi.\\nMeanwhile, Wahyu and Dagu confront Tama. Wahyu kills Dagu before taking Tama hostage. Tama taunts Wahyu by revealing that he knew they were going to raid the building, that Wahyu was set up by his corrupt superior Reza, and that he will be killed regardless of if he escapes. A panicked and desperate Wahyu kills Tama and then attempts suicide, only to find he is out of ammunition. Andi uses his influence to allow Rama to leave with the injured Bowo and a detained Wahyu. Andi also hands over blackmail recordings Tama made of the corrupt officials he dealt with, telling him to contact Officer Bunawar. Rama asks Andi to come home, but Andi refuses and asserts that he can protect Rama inside this criminal underworld, but that Rama cannot do the same for him on the outside. As Rama, Bowo, and Wahyu leave, Andi turns around and walks back to the apartment block, smiling for the first time.\\n\"},\n",

The hotel manager reveals that single people have 45 days to find a partner or they will be transformed into an animal of their choice (the dog accompanying David is his brother Bob). David is set on becoming a lobster, should he fail. David makes the acquaintance of Robert, a man with a lisp, and John, a man with a limp. Guests are fixated on finding a mate with whom they share superficial traits such as minor ailments, which they believe to be the key to compatibility.\\nThe hotel has many rules and rituals: masturbation is banned, but sexual stimulation by the hotel maid is mandatory, and guests attend dances and watch propaganda extolling the advantages of partnership. Residents can extend their deadline by hunting and tranquilizing the single people who live in the forest; each captured \"loner\" earns them one day. On the way to a hunt, a woman with a fondness for butter biscuits offers David sexual favours, which he declines. She tells him that if she fails to find a mate, she will kill herself by jumping from a hotel window.\\nJohn wins the affections of a woman with constant nosebleeds by purposely smashing his nose in secret. They move to the couples\\' section to begin a month-long trial partnership. David later decides to court a notoriously cruel woman who has tranquilized more loners than anyone else. Their initial conversation is accompanied by the screams of the biscuit-loving woman, who has injured herself by jumping from a first floor window. David pretends to enjoy the woman\\'s suffering to gain the heartless woman\\'s interest. He later joins her in a hot tub where she feigns choking on an olive to test him. Noticing that he makes no attempt to help her, she decides that they are a match, and the two are shifted to the couples\\' suite. David wakes up one morning and finds she has killed his brother. As David tearfully mourns him, she concludes that their relationship is a lie and attempts to drag him to the hotel manager to have him punished, turned into the \"animal that no one wants to be\". However, he escapes and, with the help of a sympathetic maid (who is later revealed to be a mole working for the loners), tranquilizes his partner and transforms her into an unspecified animal.\\nDavid escapes the hotel and joins the loners in the woods. In contrast to the hotel, they forbid any kind of romance, which is punishable by mutilation. David, who is short-sighted, begins a secret relationship with a woman who is also short-sighted. They develop a gestural language they use to communicate. They are taken on covert missions to the nearby city, where their cover requires them to appear as husband and wife, which they secretly enjoy.\\nThe loners launch a raid to sabotage the hotel. David tells the woman with nosebleeds that John has been faking his. Other loners hold the hotel manager and her husband at gunpoint, tricking him into shooting his wife to save himself, but the gun is not loaded. They leave the couple to face each other.\\nThe leader of the loners obtains David\\'s journal and discovers his plan to escape with the short-sighted woman.

       "  'Description': 'The Wedding Banquet[3] is a 1993 romantic comedy film directed, produced and co-written by Ang Lee. The story concerns a gay Taiwanese immigrant man (played by Winston Chao, in his film debut) who marries a mainland Chinese woman (May Chin) to placate his parents (Gua Ah-leh and Lung Sihung) and get her a green card. His plan backfires when his parents arrive in the United States to plan his wedding banquet and he has to hide the truth of his gay partner (Mitchell Lichtenstein). It was a co-production of Lee\\'s Good Machine production company, and the Taiwanese Central Motion Picture Corporation.\\nLee’s second feature film and his first to get a theatrical release in the United States, The Wedding Banquet premiered at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Golden Bear. It was both a critical and commercial success, becoming the most profitable film of 1993[4] and won five Golden Horse Awards, including Best Film and Best Director. It received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Foreign-Language Film, as well as six Independent Spirit Award nominations.\\nTogether with Pushing Hands (1991) and Eat Drink Man Woman (1994), all showing the Confucian family at risk, and all starring the Taiwanese actor Lung Sihung, The Wedding Banquet forms what has been called Lee\\'s \"Father Knows Best\" trilogy.[5]\\n\\nPlot: Gao Wai-Tung is a gay Taiwanese immigrant in Manhattan, happily living with his partner Simon. He has not come out to his traditionally-minded parents who live back in Taiwan, and as he’s in his late-20s, they’ve become eager to see him get married and have a child in order to continue the family line. When his parents hire a dating service, Wai-Tung and Simon stall for time by inventing numerous impossible demands. They demand an opera singer and add that she must be 5\\'9\", have two PhDs, and speak five languages. To their shock, the service actually locates a 5\\'8\" Chinese woman who meets all but one of their qualifiers (having only a single PhD instead of two). She is very gracious when Wai-Tung explains his dilemma, as she too is hiding a relationship (with a white man).\\nAt Simon\\'s insistence, Wai-Tung decides to marry one of his tenants, Wei-Wei, a penniless artist from mainland China in need of a green card. Besides helping Wei-Wei, the couple hope that this will placate Wai-Tung\\'s parents. To complicate matters, Mr. and Mrs. Gao announce they will visit. Before the parents arrive, Simon tells Wei-Wei everything she needs to know about Wai-Tung\\'s habits, body, and lifestyle; and the three hastily take down all gay-related content from their house and replace it with traditional Chinese scrolls.\\nMr. and Mrs. Gao arrive bringing gifts and US$30,000 to hold an extravagant wedding for their son; believing he is involved with a wealthy woman. Wai-Tung dares not tell his parents the truth, because his father (a retired army officer) has just recovered from a stroke. As a part of the lie, Wai-Tung introduces Simon as his landlord. \\nA day after his parents arrive, Wai-Tung announces that he and Wei-Wei plan to get their marriage certificate at city hall. However, the heartbreak his mother experiences at the courthouse wedding (both at the arrangement and at the discovery of her son\\'s relation with an underclass woman) prepares the story for a shift to drama. The only way to atone for the ‘disgraceful’ wedding is a magnificent wedding banquet, offered by Mr. Gao\\'s former batman, who now owns a restaurant and reception hall. After the banquet, several relatives come up to their hotel room for an unsolicited after-party and they demand that the newlyweds get in bed naked before they all leave. This leads to a drunken tryst between the unwilling couple that ends in Wei-Wei’s pregnancy. Simon is extremely upset when he finds out and his relationship with Wai-Tung begins to deteriorate.\\nShortly after, Mr. Gao suffers another stroke, and in a moment of anger, after a fight with both Simon and Wei-Wei, Wai-Tung admits the truth to his mother. She is shocked and insists that he not tell his father. However, the perceptive Mr. Gao has seen more than he is letting on; he secretly tells Simon that he knows about their relationships and, appreciating the considerable sacrifices he made for his biological son, takes Simon as his son as well. Simon accepts the hongbao from Wai-Tung\\'s father, a symbolic admission of their relationship. Mr. Gao seeks and receives Simon\\'s promise not to tell his secret for (as he points out) without the sham marriage, he\\'d never have a grandchild.\\nWhile en route to an appointment for an abortion, Wei-Wei decides to keep the baby, and asks Simon to stay together with Wai-Tung and be the baby\\'s second father. \\nIn the final parting scene, as Wai-Tung\\'s parents prepare to fly home, Mrs. Gao has forged an emotional bond to daughter-in-law Wei-Wei. Mr. Gao accepts Simon and warmly shakes his hand. In the end, both derive some happiness from the situation, and they walk off to board the aircraft, leaving the unconventional family to figure themselves out.\\n'},\n",

Alfonso Cuarón and Guillermo del Toro (who make up the \"Three Amigos\" with González Iñárritu in the film industry) serve as associate producers. The film follows Uxbal, a criminal and father who becomes diagnosed with prostate cancer and seeks to settle various things around his life before he dies. The title is in reference to the phonetic spelling in Spanish of the English word beautiful.\\nBiutiful premiered at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, and was released theatrically by Videocine in Mexico and United International Pictures in Spain on 22 October 2010 and 3 December, respectively. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and was a box-office bomb grossing $24.7 million worldwide on a budget of $35 million. It was nominated for two Academy Awards in 2011: Best Foreign Language and Best Actor for Bardem; his nomination was the first entirely Spanish-language performance to be nominated for the award. Bardem also received the Best Actor Award at Cannes for his work on the film.\\n\\nPlot: Uxbal lives in a shabby apartment in Barcelona with his two young children, Ana and Mateo. He is separated from their mother Marambra, an alcoholic prostitute with bipolar disorder. Having grown up an orphan, Uxbal has no family other than his brother Tito, who works in the construction business (and sometimes solicits Marambra\\'s services). Uxbal earns a living by procuring work for a group of Chinese illegal immigrants who make forged designer goods which a group of African street vendors then sell. He also works as a medium to the dead, passing on messages from the recently deceased at wakes and funerals. When he is diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer, leaving him with only a few months to live, his world progressively falls apart.\\nUxbal initially begins chemotherapy, but he later ends the treatment at the advice of his friend Bea, an alternative healer. She gives him two black stones which she asks him to give his children before he dies. The group of Africans are brutally arrested by the police, despite Uxbal\\'s regular payment of bribes, because they also deal in drugs. When one of them is deported back to Senegal, Uxbal offers his wife Ige and baby son a room in his apartment. Meanwhile, an attempt at reconciliation with Marambra fails when Uxbal realizes she cannot be trusted to look after their children. As the Chinese are out of work, Tito brokers a deal to get them employed at a construction site. However, almost all of them die in the night from carbon monoxide poisoning, as the cheap gas heaters Uxbal bought in an effort to help were not safe. An attempt by a human trafficker to dump the bodies into the sea fails when they are washed up on the shore shortly after, causing a media sensation.\\nAs Uxbal\\'s health continues to deteriorate, he is plagued with guilt that he is responsible for the expulsion of the Senegalese and the death of the Chinese. With his death drawing nearer, he realizes that there will be nobody to take care of Ana and Mateo once he is gone. He entrusts the remainder of his savings to Ige, asking her to stay with the children after his death. She accepts his request but later decides to use the money to return to Africa. At the apartment, Uxbal sees Ige\\'s silhouette behind the bathroom door and hears her voice saying she has returned. Uxbal lies down next to Ana and, after having passed on to her a diamond ring which his father had once given to his mother, he dies. In a snowy winter landscape he is reunited with his father, who had died before Uxbal\\'s birth shortly after having fled Francoist Spain for Mexico.\\n'},\n",

Written and produced by Bernd Eichinger, it stars Moritz Bleibtreu, Martina Gedeck, and Johanna Wokalek. The film is based on the 1985 German best selling non-fiction book of the same name by Stefan Aust. It retells the story of the early years of the West German far-left terrorist organisation the Rote Armee Fraktion (Red Army Fraction, or Red Army Faction, a.k.a. RAF) from 1967 to 1977.\\nThe film was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 81st Academy Awards. It was also nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 66th Golden Globe Awards.\\n\\nPlot: On 2 June 1967, the Shah of Iran visits West Berlin and attends a performance at the Deutsche Oper. Angered at his policies in governing Iran, members of the West German student movement protest. The police and the Shah\\'s security team attack the protesters, and unarmed protester Benno Ohnesorg is fatally shot by Officer Karl-Heinz Kurras.\\nOhnesorg\\'s death outrages West Germany, including left wing journalist Ulrike Meinhof, who claims in a televised debate that the democratically elected government of West Germany is a fascist police state. Inspired by Meinhof\\'s rhetoric, charismatic radicals Gudrun Ensslin and Andreas Baader mastermind the Frankfurt department store firebombing\\xa0[de] of 1968. While covering their trial, Ulrike Meinhof finds herself deeply moved by their commitment to armed struggle against what they see as a Neo-Nazi Government. She secures a jailhouse interview with Ensslin and the two strike up a close friendship. Soon after, Meinhof leaves her husband for journalist Peter Homann, an associate of the radicals.\\nMeanwhile, Ensslin and Baader have been released pending an appeal and attract various young people, including Astrid Proll and Peter-Jurgen Boock. After spending some time abroad, Baader, Ensslin and Proll return to West Germany and begin living with Meinhof. Increasingly bored with her middle-class life, Meinhof longs to take more violent action. Even though Ensslin tells her that sacrifices must be made for the revolution, Meinhof does not wish to leave her children. But then, Baader is arrested. Using her connections, Meinhof arranges for him to be interviewed off prison grounds, where Ensslin and the others spring him from custody. While the plan called for Meinhof to look like an innocent journalist caught in a prison break, she flees with Baader and Ensslin, thereby incriminating herself in the attempted murders of an unarmed civilian and two policemen.\\nAfter leaving Meinhof\\'s two children in Sicily, the group receives training in a Fatah camp in Jordan, where the egotistical and promiscuous Germans enrage their Muslim hosts. Homann leaves the group after overhearing Meinhof, Baader, and Ensslin asking Fatah to kill him. Having also learned that Meinhof wishes to send her two children to a training camp for suicide bombers, Homann informs Meinhof\\'s former colleague Stefan Aust, who returns the children to their father.\\nReturning to Germany and styling themselves the Red Army Faction (RAF), Baader and his followers launch a campaign of bank robberies. In response, BKA chief Horst Herold orders all local police to be put at Federal command for one day. During that day, RAF member Petra Schelm drives through a roadblock and is chased by two cops. When cornered, she initiates a gunfight and is fatally shot by their return fire. Regarding this as murder, Baader and Ensslin overrule Meinhof\\'s objections and begin systematically bombing police stations and United States Military bases. As grisly footage of the maimed and the dead appears onscreen, Meinhof\\'s press statements rationalizing the bombings are heard in voiceover.\\nAs things escalate, Herold orders the BKA to pioneer criminal profiling and RAF members begin to be arrested. Baader and Holger Meins are caught after a shoot-out with police. Ensslin and Meinhof are captured soon after. In separate prisons, the RAF inmates stage a hunger strike which results in Meins\\' death. The German student movement considers this to be murder. The authorities then move Baader, Ensslin, Meinhof, and Jan-Carl Raspe to Stammheim Prison, where they work on their defense for their trial and smuggle orders outside.\\nIn 1975, a group of younger RAF recruits seize the West German embassy in Stockholm where they murder two hostages. The siege ends with an explosion which injures all the terrorists and hostages. RAF member Ulrich Wessel dies two hours later in a local hospital while Siegfried Hausner is critically wounded, extradited to West Germany and dies in a prison hospital. The imprisoned RAF members are appalled by the poor execution of their orders. Meanwhile, Herold\\'s assistant asks why people who have never met Baader are willing to take orders from him. Herold replies, \"A myth.\"\\nMeinhof, suffering from depression and remorse over the deaths caused by their bombings, is subjected to sadistic emotional abuse by Baader and Ensslin, who call her a traitor and \"a knife in the RAF\\'s back\". In response, Meinhof hangs herself in her cell. The imprisoned RAF members accuse West Germany\\'s Government of murdering her during their trial and are widely believed.\\nUpon completing her sentence, Brigitte Mohnhaupt takes over command of the RAF. She informs Boock that Baader has forbidden any more attacks on \"the people\" and enlists his help smuggling weapons into Stammheim. In retaliation for the \"murders\" of Meins, Hausner, and Meinhof, the RAF assassinates West Germany\\'s Attorney General, Siegfried Buback. Mohnhaupt, Christian Klar, and Susanne Albrecht, also attempt to kidnap Dresdner Bank President Jürgen Ponto, who fights back and is shot dead. Knowing that the imprisoned RAF members have ordered both murders, the West German Government returns them to solitary confinement. Even so, Ensslin and Baader obtain two-way radios and continue smuggling orders outside.\\nMohnhaupt then abducts industrialist Hanns-Martin Schleyer and demands the release of her imprisoned comrades in exchange for not killing him. When West German authorities fail to meet their demands, the RAF and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijack Lufthansa Flight 181. The hijacking ends with the plane being stormed and the hostages saved. In Stammheim, Baader warns a West German Government negotiator that the violence will continue to escalate. Ensslin makes the same prediction to the prison chaplain and claims that the West German Government is about to murder her and her imprisoned comrades.\\nThe following morning, corrections officers find Baader and Raspe shot to death in their cells as the handguns Mohnhaupt smuggled into the prison lie nearby. Ensslin is found hanging from the steel bars of the window. They also find Irmgard Möller stabbed four times in the chest, but still alive. When the news reaches the free RAF members, they are devastated and certain that the trio was murdered. To their shock, Mohnhaupt explains that Baader, Ensslin, Möller, and Raspe \"are not victims and never were\". She explains that they, like Meinhof, were \"in control of the outcome until the very end\". When the RAF members react with stunned disbelief, Mohnhaupt responds, \"You did not know them. Stop thinking that they were different than they were.\"\\nIn a sign that RAF terrorism will continue, the last moments of the film show the murder of hostage Hanns-Martin Schleyer. In an ironic commentary on the violence of the era, Bob Dylan\\'s \"Blowin\\' in the Wind\" plays during the credits.\\n'},\n",

He is a Portuguese man in The Renaissance shipwrecked on the coast of Africa. He is the master in this life, his wife from the first incarnation shipwrecked with him as his spurned lover, and the raider who spirited her away is her steadfast friend.\\nFifth incarnation: He is a modern man in New York, paying the consequences of cowardly indecision and gaining the strength to address the children he lost lifetimes ago.

Beca then returns, apologizes to the Bellas for changing the set without Aubrey\\'s permission during the Semi-Finals, and asks to be given a second chance. After all of the Bellas have a heart-to-heart conversation, Beca rejoins the group, and Aubrey relinquishes her half of the leadership to Beca. Chloe discovers that after her spring break node removal surgery, she is able to sing bass notes.

The film stars Jamie Bell as Tintin, alongside Andy Serkis, and Daniel Craig.[5][6][7] In the film, Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock (Serkis) search for the treasure of the Unicorn, a ship once captained by Haddock's ancestor Sir Francis Haddock, but face dangerous pursuit by Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (Craig), the descendant of Sir Haddock's nemesis, Red Rackham.[8]\\nSpielberg and Hergé admired each other's work; the director acquired the film rights to The Adventures of Tintin after the author's death in 1983, and re-optioned them in 2002. Filming was due to begin in October 2008 for a 2010 release, but the release was delayed to 2011 after Universal Pictures backed out of producing the film with Paramount Pictures, which had provided $30 million in pre-production; Columbia Pictures replaced Universal as co-financer. The delay resulted in Thomas Brodie-Sangster, who was originally cast as Tintin, departing and being replaced by Bell. The film draws inspiration from the Tintin volumes The Crab with the Golden Claws (1941), The Secret of the Unicorn (1943), and Red Rackham's Treasure (1944). Principal photography began in January 2009 and finished that July, with a combination of voice acting, motion capture, and traditional computer-animation being used.\\nThe Adventures of Tintin premiered in Brussels, Hergé's home region, on 22 October 2011, and was theatrically released in Europe by Sony Pictures Releasing International on 26 October and in the United States by Paramount Pictures on 21 December, in Digital 3D and IMAX 3D formats.[9][10] The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the stylized motion capture animation (particularly the faithful character designs to Hergé's works), visual effects, action sequences, cast performances, and musical score, with the film positively compared to Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).[11] The Adventures of Tintin was also a commercial success, grossing over $374 million,[4] and received numerous awards and nominations, including being the first motion-captured animated film (and first non-Pixar film) to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film,[12] while John Williams was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score.[13] A sequel directed by Jackson has been announced, but has since stalled in development hell.\\n\\nPlot: \"},\n",

It is both Mather and Saint Leger's feature directorial debuts. The film stars Guy Pearce, Maggie Grace, Vincent Regan, Joe Gilgun, Lennie James and Peter Stormare. The plot follows Snow (Pearce), a man framed for a crime he did not commit, who is offered his freedom in exchange for rescuing the President's daughter Emilie (Grace) from the orbital prison MS One, which has been taken over by its inmates, led by Alex (Regan) and his psychotic brother Hydell (Gilgun).\\nPrincipal photography took place in Belgrade, Serbia. It premiered on 7 April 2012 at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film, and was released on 13 April 2012 in North America and on 18 April 2012 in France.\\nA French court has ruled the film plagiarises the plot of the cult classic Escape from New York and its sequel, Escape from L.A..[1]\\n\\nPlot: In 2079, CIA operative Snow is arrested for murdering Colonel Frank Armstrong, who had uncovered evidence of a mole selling secrets about the United States space program. Secret Service director Scott Langral, on advice from the President, has Snow convicted of murder and espionage. Snow is sentenced to thirty years on the maximum security space penitentiary MS One, where prisoners are kept in stasis for the length of their sentences. Snow's friend and fellow agent Harry Shaw tries to locate Snow's contact Mace, who knows where Frank's briefcase containing the stolen secrets is hidden.\\nMeanwhile, the President's daughter Emilie arrives on MS One to investigate claims that keeping prisoners in stasis can cause them to develop mental instability. The warden allows her to interview Hydell, a deranged prisoner. He manages to escape and releases all of the prisoners, starting a riot led by his brother Alex. Emilie is shot, and is captured along with others. Shaw convinces Langral and the President to send Snow to rescue Emilie, rather than risk her life in a siege. Snow is initially reluctant to go, but agrees after Shaw tells him that Mace is on MS One and could help Snow prove his innocence. Langral initially attempts to trick Alex into releasing Emilie, but Hydell disagrees and Snow is forced to infiltrate MS One. Alex realizes that Emilie is the President's daughter and secures her, but she escapes with her bodyguard Hock and they hide in a secure room. A problem with the oxygen supply brings Hock to sacrifice his life by suicide in order to stop himself from using up oxygen so as to buy Emilie more time.\\nSnow breaks into the secure room and rescues Emilie after administering first aid for her wounds. Snow then changes Emilie's hair & clothing to conceal her gender, allowing them to walk through the prison population without being noticed. They find Mace, but the stasis has given him dementia and made him incoherent. Snow and Emilie bring Mace with them and attempt to reach the escape pod. With no one at the helm, the prison falls out of orbit and crashes into the International Space Station. The collision causes a hull breach, killing Mace. Snow brings Emilie to the escape pod, but discovers it has only one seat. Realizing that he has been sent there to die, he sends Emilie on her way, but she allows the pod to launch without her because she believes the remaining hostages will be killed. Hydell contacts Emilie and threatens the hostages unless she reveals her location; after she does, however, he kills them anyway.\\nSnow and Emilie discover evidence that the prisoners were being illegally used as test subjects. Alex finds and captures Emilie; he also shoots Snow, leaving him for dead. Alex learns that Hydell has killed all of the hostages; he contacts the President, threatening to let Hydell and the prisoners rape Emilie if they are not released. The President refuses to allow a siege and risk Emilie, causing Langral to temporarily relieve him of his command. Langral orders the destruction of MS One. Hydell tries to rape Emilie as promised, but is stopped by Alex. Hydell and Alex fight, resulting in Alex's death. Hydell then tries to stab Emilie, but Snow arrives and knocks him out. Snow and Emilie flee from Hydell and the remaining prisoners. Meanwhile, Langral's men plant a bomb on the prison. Snow and Emilie use space suits and jump from MS One as it detonates. Using their suits, Snow and Emilie re-enter Earth's atmosphere and land safely in New York City, where Snow is arrested.\\nEmilie later realizes that Mace's incoherent rambling was actually a code revealing the location of Frank's briefcase. Examining the motel room where Frank was killed, Emilie realizes that Langral saw what he believed was Snow shooting Frank on a mirrored door which only showed part of what happened when in reality Snow was shooting at the actual assassin at the same time that Frank was shot. Snow gives the briefcase to Shaw, who unlocks it but is shocked to find it empty. Snow notes that he had not given Shaw the combination, and Shaw is revealed to be the mole and arrested. However, he believes that he will get off lightly as people like him are needed. Snow is released and his possessions returned, including a lighter given to him by Frank before his death. Examining the lighter, Snow finds a memory card containing the real secret information hidden inside. Emilie meets Snow and teases him after discovering his first name is Marion; the pair walk away together.\\n\"},\n",

It recounts Belfort\\'s career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm, Stratton Oakmont, engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on Wall Street, leading to his downfall. Leonardo DiCaprio, who was also a producer of the film, stars as Belfort in his fifth collaboration with Scorsese following Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006) and Shutter Island (2010). The film also stars Jonah Hill as his business partner and friend Donnie Azoff, Margot Robbie as his second wife, Naomi Lapaglia, and Kyle Chandler as FBI agent Patrick Denham.\\nDiCaprio and Warner Bros. secured the rights to Belfort\\'s memoir in 2007, with Scorsese set to direct, but content restrictions stalled production. The project was later greenlit by the independent production house Red Granite Pictures. Filming took place in late 2012 in New York City and was shot mostly on 35mm film stock.\\nThe film premiered in New York City on December 17, 2013, and was released in the United States on December 25, 2013, by Paramount Pictures. It was the first major American film to be released exclusively through digital distribution.[3] It was a major commercial success, grossing $406.9 million worldwide during its theatrical run, becoming Scorsese\\'s highest-grossing film.[4] The film was controversial for its moral ambiguity and lack of sympathy for victims, as well as explicit sexual content, extreme profanity, depiction of hard drug use, and use of animals during production. It set a Guinness World Record for the most instances of swearing in a film. The film\\'s financing became implicated in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad corruption scandal; the U.S. Department of Justice and the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission investigated Red Granite Pictures, and producer Riza Aziz was arrested in 2019.\\nThe film received positive reviews (and some moral censure) from critics and appeared on several \"best of the year\" lists. It was nominated for several awards, including five at the 86th Academy Awards ceremony: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor (for DiCaprio) and Best Supporting Actor (for Hill). DiCaprio won Best Actor – Musical or Comedy at the 71st Golden Globe Awards, where the film was also nominated for Best Picture – Musical or Comedy.\\n\\nPlot: In 1987, Jordan Belfort lands a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for L.F. Rothschild, employed under Mark Hanna. He is quickly enticed by the drug-fueled stockbroker culture and Hanna\\'s belief that a broker\\'s only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan loses his job following Black Monday, the largest one-day stock market drop in history, and takes a job at a boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in penny stocks. He makes a small fortune thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions.\\nJordan befriends his neighbor Donnie Azoff, and the two found their own company. They recruit several of Jordan\\'s friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the \"hard sell\". Jordan\\'s tactics and salesmanship largely contribute to the success of his pump and dump scheme, in which misleading, positive statements inflate a stock\\'s price so it can be sold at an artificially high price. When the scheme\\'s perpetrators sell their overvalued securities, the price plummets, and those who were conned into buying at the inflated price are left with stock that is suddenly worth much less than they paid for it. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name Stratton Oakmont in 1989.\\nAfter an exposé in Forbes, hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company. Jordan becomes immensely successful and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia; when his wife finds out, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi in 1991. Meanwhile, the SEC and the FBI begin investigating Stratton Oakmont.\\nIn 1993, Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours after securing the IPO of Steve Madden. This brings him and his firm further FBI attention. To hide his money, Jordan opens a Swiss bank account with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi\\'s aunt Emma, who is a British subject and thus outside the immediate reach of American authorities. He uses the wife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland.\\nDonnie and Brad get into a heated argument in public during a money exchange, resulting in Brad\\'s arrest, but Donnie escapes. Jordan learns from his private investigator that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. Fearing for his son, Jordan\\'s father advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan\\'s lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison, but Jordan cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech.\\nIn 1996, Jordan, Donnie, and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy when they learn that Emma has died. Jordan proceeds to Switzerland to forge her name and save the account. To bypass border controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, but the ship capsizes in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine; Jordan takes this as a sign from God to address his worsening drug addiction and attempts to sober up.\\nIn 1998 Saurel gets arrested for a separate crime and informs the FBI about Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency. Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their daughter and infant son. In a cocaine-fueled rage, Jordan hits Naomi and tries to drive away with his daughter but crashes his car in the driveway.\\nLater, Jordan wears a wire to work but slips a note to Donnie, warning him. The FBI discovers this, arrests Jordan, and raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. Despite breaching his deal, Jordan receives a reduced sentence of 36 months in a minimum security prison for his testimony and is released in 2000 after serving 22 months. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales techniques.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': 'Audition (オーディション, Ōdishon) is a 1999 Japanese horror film  directed by Takashi Miike, based on the 1997 novel by Ryu Murakami. Starring Ryo Ishibashi and Eihi Shiina, the film is about a widower, Shigeharu Aoyama (Ishibashi), who stages a phony audition to meet a potential new romantic partner. After interviewing several women, Aoyama becomes interested in Asami (Shiina), whose dark past affects their relationship.\\nAudition was originally a project of the Japanese company Omega Project, who wanted to make a horror film after the great financial success of their previous production Ring. To create the film, the company purchased the rights to Murakami\\'s book and hired screenwriter Daisuke Tengan and director Miike to film an adaptation. The cast and crew consisted primarily of people Miike had worked with on previous projects, with the exception of Shiina, who had worked as a model prior to her career in film. The film was shot in about three weeks in Tokyo.\\nAudition premiered, with a few other Japanese horror films, at the Vancouver International Film Festival, but it received much more attention when it was shown at the Rotterdam International Film Festival in 2000, where it received the FIPRESCI Prize and the KNF Award. Following a theatrical release in Japan, the film continued to play at festivals and had theatrical releases in the United States and United Kingdom, followed by several home media releases.\\nAudition was received positively by Western film critics on its release, with many noting the final torture sequence in the film and how it contrasts with the non-horrific scenes before. The film has appeared on several lists of the best horror films ever made, and has had an influence on other horror films and directors including Eli Roth and the Soska sisters.\\n\\nPlot: Shigeharu Aoyama is a widower whose son Shigehiko says that he should find a new wife. Shigeharu\\'s friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa, a film producer, devises a mock casting audition at which young women audition for the \"part\" of Shigeharu\\'s new wife. Shigeharu agrees to the plan and is immediately enchanted by Asami Yamazaki, attracted to her apparent emotional depth.\\nYasuhisa cannot reach any of the references in Asami\\'s résumé, such as a music producer she said she worked for, who is missing. However, Shigeharu is so enthralled by her that he pursues her anyway. She lives in an empty apartment, containing a sack and a phone. For four days after the audition, she sits perfectly still next to the phone waiting for it to ring. When it finally does, she answers, pretending that she never expected Shigeharu to call. After several dates, she agrees to accompany him to a seaside hotel, where Shigeharu intends to propose marriage. At the hotel, Asami reveals burn scars on her body. Before having sex, Asami demands that Shigeharu pledge his love to her and no one else. Deeply moved, Shigeharu agrees. In the morning, Asami is nowhere to be found.\\nShigeharu tries to track her down using her résumé, but as Yasuhisa warned, all of the contacts are dead ends. At the dance studio where she said she was trained, he finds a man with prosthetic feet who is shown to be torturous to Asami in her childhood. The bar where she said she worked has been abandoned for a year following the murder and dismemberment of the owner. A passerby tells Shigeharu that the police found three extra fingers, an extra ear, and an extra tongue when they recovered the body; Shigeharu has hallucinations of the body pieces. Meanwhile, Asami goes to Shigeharu\\'s house and finds a photo of his late wife. Enraged, she drugs his liquor. Shigeharu comes home, pours a drink, and after a short while feels the effects of the drug. A flashback shows that the sack in Asami\\'s apartment contains a man missing both feet, his tongue, one ear and three fingers on one hand. He crawls out and begs for food. Asami vomits into a dog dish and places it on the floor for the man. The man sticks his face into the vomit and hungrily consumes it.\\nShigeharu collapses from the drug. Asami injects him with a paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that, just like everyone else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into the skin below his eyes, saying \"deeper\" continuously as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with a wire saw. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Shigeharu\\'s other foot, and she sneaks up on him with a can of mace. As she attacks the boy, Shigeharu appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems to be only a nightmare; Shigeharu proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to reality - his previous awakening having been false - to find his son fighting Asami. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Shigeharu tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.\\n'},\n",

In his investigation, Scott startles Santa Claus who is on the roof, who then slips, falls off the roof, and dies in the snow below.

Starring Clive Owen and Naomi Watts, the film follows an Interpol agent and an American district attorney who jointly investigate corruption within the IBBC, a fictional merchant bank based in Luxembourg. It serves organized crime and corrupt governments as a banker and as an arms broker. The bank's ruthless managers assassinate potential threats, including their own employees.\\nInspired by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) scandal of the 1980s, the film raises concerns about how global finance affects international politics across the world. Production began in Berlin in September 2008, including the construction of a life-size replica of New York's Guggenheim Museum for the film's central shootout scene. The film opened the 59th Berlin International Film Festival on 5 February 2009. The Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus praised the action sequences and locations but criticized the plot.[7]\\n\\nPlot: Louis Salinger, an Interpol detective, and Eleanor Whitman, an Assistant District Attorney from Manhattan, are assigned to investigate the International Bank of Business and Credit (IBBC), which funds criminal activities such as money laundering, terrorism, arms trading, and the destabilization of governments. Salinger's and Whitman's investigation takes them to Milan, where the IBBC assassinates Umberto Calvini, an arms manufacturer and Italian prime ministerial candidate. The assassin diverts suspicion to a local assassin with political connections to the Red Brigades, who is then promptly killed by a corrupt policeman. Salinger and Whitman get a lead on the second assassin, but the policeman confronts the two and orders them out of the country. At the airport, they are able to check the security camera footage for clues on the whereabouts of the bank's assassin, and follow a suspect to New York City.\\nIn New York, Salinger and Whitman are met by two New York Police Department (NYPD) detectives, Iggy Ornelas and Bernie Ward, who have a photograph of the assassin's face. Salinger, Ornelas, and Ward locate Dr. Isaacson to whose practice the assassin's leg brace has been traced, and they are able to follow him to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.\\nJonas Skarssen, the chairman of the IBBC, reveals to his lawyer White and security adviser Wexler that Calvini was killed so that they could have his sons buy missile guidance systems in which the bank has invested. Since the bank knows that Salinger and Whitman are close to finding their assassin, they send a team of hitmen to kill him, while Wexler is arrested by Ornelas. As Salinger and Ward speak to the assassin and attempt to arrest him, a shootout at the Guggenheim erupts when a number of gunmen attack them. Ward is killed in the chaos, and Salinger is forced to team up with the assassin to fight off the gunmen. However, the assassin is mortally wounded during their escape and dies of his injuries.\\nWhen Salinger goes to interrogate Wexler, a veteran Stasi officer, the latter reveals that the IBBC is practically untouchable due to its connections to terrorist organizations, drug cartels, governments, and powerful corporations, though Wexler indicates a willingness to help Salinger take down the IBBC. Meanwhile, Salinger persuades Whitman to let him continue alone.\\nIn Italy, Salinger tells Calvini's sons of the IBBC's responsibility for their father's murder, prompting them to cancel the deal with the bank and order White to be killed. Salinger then accompanies Wexler to Istanbul, where Skarssen is buying the guidance systems from their only other manufacturer, Ahmet Sunay. Salinger attempts to record the conversation so that he can obstruct the deal by proving to the buyers that the missiles will be useless, but he ultimately fails. Both Wexler and Skarssen are then killed by a hitman contracted by the Calvinis to avenge their father's murder. Salinger is left stunned, his investigation, pursuit, and determination to bring down the IBBC having led to nothing.\\nAfterwards, the bank successfully continues its operations despite the death of Skarssen, as he had predicted to Salinger before he was killed. However, with the new and more aggressive chairman, the IBBC's increased expansion and aggression ultimately lead to greater scrutiny, leading to a United States Senate investigation headed by Whitman.\\n\"},\n",

The film is highly regarded, ranking #2 in the Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures. Its success led to a sequel, A Better Tomorrow II, also directed by Woo, and A Better Tomorrow 3: Love & Death in Saigon, a prequel directed by Tsui Hark. It has been remade several times.\\nThe film was Chow Yun-fat\\'s breakout role and launched him as one of the top superstars in the Hong Kong film industry. Chow\\'s character \"Mark Lee\" has been imitated by many fans even decades after the film\\'s release.[7] Following this film, Chow went on to make several more notable films with Woo.\\n\\nPlot: Sung Tse-Ho is a senior member of a powerful Hong Kong triad, managing a lucrative printing and distributing operation that produces counterfeit American bank notes. Ho is a respected member of the organization, entrusted with the most important transactions. Mark Lee[8] is his best friend, bodyguard, and business partner. The prologue follows a day in the life of Ho and Mark as they watch a fresh batch of counterfeit notes being printed and meet with foreign clients to trade their product for counterfeit Hong Kong dollar notes.\\nMeanwhile, Ho\\'s younger brother, Kit, has just graduated high school and is currently training to join the police. Ho hides his criminal life from his brother and encourages Kit\\'s career choice, while their ailing father pleads for Ho to leave his life of crime. Ho agrees, deciding that he will retire from the triad after his next deal in Taiwan. Shing, a low-ranking triad member, joins Ho after he agrees to mentor him. However, they are ambushed by the Taiwanese triads, leading to a shootout in which Ho and Shing flee into a sewage tunnel entrance, pursued by local law enforcement. Ho tells Shing to run and surrenders to the police in order to buy time for him to escape, leading to a three-year prison sentence.\\nAfter learning of the deal, the triads attempt to kidnap Ho\\'s father as leverage to ensure Ho\\'s silence in prison; Ho\\'s father is fatally stabbed before Kit and his girlfriend Jackie manage to subdue the attacker. With his dying breath, he pleads Kit to forgive his brother for his criminal actions, and an enraged Kit blames Ho for their father\\'s death. Later, Mark travels to Taiwan to get answers from the Taiwanese triad. He visits a restaurant where the gangster who planned the ambush is dining and kills him following a shootout with his bodyguards. However, Mark\\'s leg is injured in the process, leaving him crippled and requiring a leg brace.\\nAfter Ho is released from prison, he is approached by a corrupt policeman, who offers to take him back to triad headquarters so he can rejoin his old organization. Ho, determined to start a new life, declines the offer and instead begins working for a taxi company run by another ex-con named Ken. During one of his shifts, Ho encounters Mark, and he discovers that his old friend is now a bitter, broken shell of his former self after Shing stripped him of his position in the triad and cast him aside in his rise to power. When they reunite, Mark urges Ho to confront Shing, but Ho refuses. Ho then seeks out Kit, now a police officer, in hopes of reconciling. \\nHowever, Ho is harshly rebuffed by Kit, who still blames Ho for their father\\'s death and because his relation to Ho is preventing him from advancing his career. In an effort to prove himself and further distance himself from his brother, Kit becomes obsessed with bringing down Shing, despite Ho\\'s warnings. Shing, hearing of Ho\\'s return to Hong Kong, tries to persuade him to return and help expand their triad into drug trafficking, but Ho refuses. Shing then has his men attack the taxi company, severely beat Mark, and lure Kit into a trap that leaves him critically wounded. Though Ho is still hesitant to take action, Mark is eventually able to persuade Ho to retaliate.\\nMark steals a computer tape containing printing plate data from the counterfeiting business and they then discover that it was Shing who set up the ambush three years prior. Meanwhile, Shing sets up triad leader Yie and shoots him dead; the witnesses are told to lie to the police that Ho was the killer.

Since its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, the film has received a positive critical reception.\\n\\nPlot: In 2006, Paul Conroy, an American civilian working in Iraq, awakes to find himself buried in a wooden coffin with only a Zippo lighter, a pen, and a BlackBerry phone at hand. As he gradually begins to piece together what has happened to him, he recalls that he and several others were ambushed by terrorists, passing out after being hit by a rock. After calling 911 in Youngstown, Ohio, the FBI in Chicago, and his employer — none of whom help him — he receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of $5 million or he will be left in the coffin to die. Along with the script Paul is to read, Paul also finds a malfunctioning flashlight, a glow stick, a flask with alcohol, and a pocket knife.\\nPaul calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will attempt to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Paul they are working to find him, to conserve the Blackberry\\'s battery life, and implores him not to make the video that Jabir has demanded. Brenner informs Paul that a man named Mark White was rescued from a similar situation three weeks prior and is now home safe with his family. Paul calls his mother, who is in a nursing home, but she barely remembers him due to severe dementia.\\nJabir calls Paul again and demands he film a ransom video, sending a photo of his colleague, Pamela, gagged with a gun to her head. Paul insists that no one will pay $5 million, so Jabir drops the amount to $1 million. Paul finds a live snake in the coffin, which he is able to drive away through a hole in the wooden crate side with a fire from the alcohol. After switching the language on the Blackberry from Arabic to English, he finds the Blackberry\\'s number, which he relays to his wife in a voicemail. Paul records the video, but the kidnappers execute Pamela anyway and send him a video of the murder. He calls Brenner, who is upset with him for making the video, which is now being played on all major networks and has received numerous views on YouTube.\\nShortly afterward, distant explosions shake the area, which damage his coffin, causing it to slowly fill with sand. His employer\\'s legal counsel calls him, asking him not to speak with anyone in order to keep the situation \"contained\". His employer then begins to record the call and informs him that he has been retroactively terminated from his job earlier that same day (before his capture) due to an alleged prohibited relationship with Pamela. Because of this, his company will not only not take any responsibility for his capture; additionally, he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension earned with the company.\\nBrenner calls to report that the explosions that damaged his coffin earlier were in fact F-16 bombings and that his kidnappers may have been killed. Paul begins to lose hope and makes a last will and testament in video form, leaving his wife his personal savings and his son his clothes. Jabir calls demanding Paul video record himself cutting off a finger, threatening Paul’s family back home by revealing their home address. Paul complies with this demand.\\nShortly after filming the video, his cell phone rings, and Paul begins to hear digging and distorted voices. The voices become clearer and the coffin opens. It is abruptly revealed that he hallucinated the encounter.\\nBrenner calls and tells Paul an insurgent has given details of where to find a man buried alive, and that they are driving out to rescue him. Paul then receives a tearful call from his wife Linda, and he assures her that he is going to be okay. As sand continues to fill the coffin to dangerous levels, giving Paul seconds left to live, Brenner calls and tells him that he and the rescue team have arrived at the burial site. Through the phone, digging is heard, but Paul cannot hear any digging around him. The team digs up a coffin and opens it, but it is revealed that the insurgent led them to the coffin of Mark White, the man Brenner claimed had been rescued.\\nKnowing that he is not going to be saved, Paul accepts his fate. Brenner profusely apologizes to Paul as the sand finally fills the coffin and he suffocates as the light goes out.\\nIn a post-credits scene, a lighter illuminates the name \"Mark White\" on the lid of the coffin, written by Paul earlier.\\n'},\n",

The children heavily featured in the films are the Pevensie siblings, and a prominent antagonist is the White Witch (also known as Queen Jadis). The franchise also includes short films, digital series, and video games.\\nFrom the seven books, three were adapted—The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005), Prince Caspian (2008), and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (2010)—which collectively grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide. The first two films were directed by Andrew Adamson and the third film was directed by Michael Apted. A fourth film was to be directed by Joe Johnston, but it was announced in 2018 that new adaptations would be made for Netflix.[1]\\n\\nPlot: C. S.

It was rumoured that The Magician's Nephew was chosen as an attempt to reboot the series, after the release of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader grossed less when compared to the two previous films.[2] In March 2011, Walden Media confirmed that they intended The Magician's Nephew to be next in the series, but stressed that it was not yet in development.[3]\\nIn October 2011, Douglas Gresham stated that Walden Media's contract with the C. S. Lewis estate had expired, hinting that Walden Media's lapse in renegotiating their contract with the C. S. Lewis estate was due to internal conflicts between both companies about the direction of future films.[4]\\nOn 1 October 2013, The C. S.

Sissi cares for her patients to the extent that they appear to be her extended family (in fact, she states that her own father is a patient in the hospital). As such, she has little experience of life outside the hospital. Meanwhile, Bodo, living with his brother, applies for a funerary job but is quickly dismissed because of his inability to control his emotions. He later robs a grocery store and during the ensuing chase indirectly causes a truck to hit Sissi. Taking cover from the police underneath the truck, Bodo finds Sissi, who cannot speak or breathe. In order to save her life, he performs an emergency tracheotomy. Once Sissi is in medical care, they are separated without Sissi ever learning his name.\\nThe circumstances of her accident prevent Sissi from re-adjusting to her mundane life at the hospital, as she obsesses about tracking down her saviour. One of her patient friends, who had accompanied her on the day of her accident, helps her do so. She manages to track down Bodo, who is not interested in maintaining contact with her or any other woman. Bodo is seen several times, in a semi-conscious state, embracing a hot stove, having to be restrained by his brother Walter. It later becomes clear that Bodo is hallucinating (or perhaps dreaming) about his deceased wife, having never fully recovered from her death.  Walter tells Sissi that Bodo\\'s wife was killed in an explosion at a filling station, while Bodo was in the washroom. After Walter finishes his explanation, Bodo arrives and throws Sissi out.\\nWalter, employed as a security guard at a local bank, involves Bodo in a planned robbery (in preparation for their impending move to Australia together). As they are overpowering the money couriers in the vault, Sissi visits the bank, following Meike\\'s instructions. As she enters, she notices that Walter is employed at the bank. The alarm is tripped by one of the couriers and Walter is shot when a security guard comes to investigate. Without thinking about it, Sissi prevents the guard from shooting the brothers and helps them escape. They deliver Walter to an emergency room, where his last words to his brother are \"get off the toilet, Bodo\" (referring to Bodo\\'s inability to move on after his wife\\'s death, seeing himself stuck in the gas station\\'s restroom). Sissi hides Bodo at the institution, where he suffers a violent breakdown upon learning of his brother\\'s death on TV. This incident brings Bodo to the attention of the head doctor at the institution, and he is treated and kept as a patient. It is during this period that Bodo explains to Sissi the true nature of his wife\\'s death; a flashback shows Bodo and his wife engaged in a serious argument at the filling station. After heading to the washroom, Bodo witnesses his wife engulfed in a huge explosion caused by her deliberate dropping  of a cigarette into a pool of gasoline.\\nSissi makes the decision to leave and asks Bodo to come with her, telling him of her dream in which they were \"brother and sister, father and mother, husband and wife\". Meanwhile, Steini, one of the patients, who recognized Bodo\\'s identity and is jealous of him spending time with Sissi, calls the police and in a delusion tries to kill Bodo by electrocution (by throwing a toaster into Bodo\\'s bathtub). The delusion, really a flashback, reveals that Steini had killed Sissi\\'s mother the same way. Bodo however catches the toaster out of the air before it can fall into the tub and chases Steini into the attic. Meanwhile, the police arrive, and Sissi realizes that her mother was in fact murdered and did not commit suicide. She follows Steini to the roof, who offers to jump to atone for his actions. She declines, saying \"You\\'re not going to jump anyway\", grabs Bodo\\'s hand, and together they jump from the roof of the building, into a small pond.\\nThe final scene (taking place at the scene of Bodo\\'s wife\\'s accident) strays into a bit of surrealism: Bodo\\'s past personality, unkempt and finally emerging from the gas station restroom, takes a seat behind the wheel, while the real Bodo gets in the back of the car. As they drive off, Sissi touches (old) Bodo\\'s face to wipe away his tears, but he stops her and does so himself, pushing her away yet again. This visibly stirs (real) Bodo, who leans forward and covers his former self\\'s eyes, forcing him to brake. \"Real\" Bodo tells \"old\" Bodo to get out and leaves him standing in the middle of the road thus symbolically taking over \"old\" Bodo\\'s life; perhaps a visual metaphor for beginning anew.\\nIn the international version of the movie, a small scene commences with the abandoned \"old\" Bodo as a more resolved ending to this surrealistic character and moment. Turning, he notices a sign indicating a bus stop in the field off the road; he waits by it, and an empty bus, driven by Walter, soon arrives to pick up this \"dead\" version of Bodo. The brothers do not speak, and they drive off a short distance before disappearing.\\nThe film ends with Bodo\\'s redemption through his acceptance of Sissi, as he is shown at last content and dry-eyed as the couple arrive at Meike\\'s seaside house on the edge of a cliff.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Description': \"The Social Dilemma is a 2020 American docudrama film directed by Jeff Orlowski and written by Orlowski, Davis Coombe, and Vickie Curtis. The documentary examines how social media's design nurtures addiction to maximize profit, and its ability to manipulate people's views, emotions, and behavior and spread conspiracy theories and disinformation. The film also examines social media's effect on mental health, in particular, the mental health of adolescents and rising teen suicide rates.\\nThe film features interviews with many former employees of social media companies along with academic researchers. Some of the interviews also note that social media platforms and big tech companies have provided some positive change for society as well. The interviewees discuss social media's role in political polarization in the United States and the influence that algorithmic advertising has had on political radicalization. The film also examines how social media platforms have impacted the spread of fake news, and how governments have used social media as a tool for propaganda. These interviews are presented alongside scripted dramatizations of a teenager's social media addiction. These dramatizations draw attention to the rising concern of the radicalization of youth on the internet.\\n\\nPlot: This documentary dives into the psychological underpinnings and the manipulation techniques by which, it claims, social media and technology companies addict users. People's online activity is watched, tracked, and measured by these companies, who then use this data to build artificial intelligence models that predict the actions of their users. Tristan Harris, former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, explains in the documentary that there are three main goals of tech companies:\\n\"}}"
